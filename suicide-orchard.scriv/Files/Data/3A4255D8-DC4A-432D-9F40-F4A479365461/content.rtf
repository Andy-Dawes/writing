\cf0 EXTERIOR: 1760. DAY. PIG STY. ATILIO'S HOUSE. VALLADOLID.\
\pard\li720\ri-720\sl-240\sb240\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 FRANCISCO is standing in the middle of the pig sty. He is scraping pig shit into a loose pile in one corner. GABRIEL stands on the outside of the sty leaning on its fence with his arms folded.\

\cf0 Now boy... The oldest Mediterranean civilizations, the Greeks, Romans and Egyptians have extensively used painting techniques based on mixtures of encaustic, likely rich in bee wax, mineral pigments such as iron, and tempera.\

\cf0 Panel 2\
GABRIEL is pointing a finger upwards to give emphasis to his point. FRANCISCO is still shovelling shit.\

\cf0 You know tempera? Francisco. No? Incredible! It is a fluid mixture of binder, water and vegetable oils.\

GABRIEL has his hands clasped behind his back and is pacing from the left of the panel to the right. He is concentrating on his 'speech'. Behind him FRANCISCO is shovelling.\

\cf0 At the end of the Roman Empire and up to the 15th century, this ancient technique was lost...\

\cf0 ...so now oil paint became what we artists use. Yes? But it has been a long journey. In Italy and Greece, olive oil was used. But the drying time was excessively long.\

\cf0 Now, about 1410, Jan Van Eyck, Flemish but still a good painter,  developed a stable varnish based on linseed oil as the binder of mineral pigments.\

\pard\li2160\ri720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 His secret was a mixture of piled glass, calcined bones and mineral pigments in linseed oil, maintained for a long time in a viscous state at boiling temperature. You understand? Francisco?\

\cf0 Now Francisco. After Van Eyck, Antonello da Messina introduced a new improvement. He cleverly added a lead oxide to the pigment-oil mixtures to increase their siccative property. Impressive, yes?\
\pard\li3600\ri-360\sb240\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 <$ScrKeepWithNext>FRANCISCO\
\pard\li2160\ri720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\cf0 Panel 6\
We see Gabriels back as he walks away from the sty. The left part of the panel is filled with FRANCISCO's face. He looks resigned.\
