\cf0 EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. FOREST PATH. IN THE FOREST.\
\pard\li720\ri-720\sl-240\sb240\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 EDWARD and MATEO are hidden in foliage. They are looking at a small clearing. In the clearing are four men. Scruffy, in a mixture of multiple uniforms and peasant clothes. They are armed - but their weapons are poor rifles and look old. The men look dirty and ill-organised. MATEO is looking at the men carefully. EDWARD is smiling at MATEO.\

\cf0 <$ScrKeepWithNext>MATEO\
\pard\li2160\ri720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 For us, for them, or for themselves? I cannot myself tell.\
\pard\li3600\ri-360\sb240\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 <$ScrKeepWithNext>EDWARD\
\pard\li2160\ri720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 I would say Republican or bandits. Equally disreputable. I'll stay. Tell the others.\

\cf0 Panel 2\
The SERGEANT and the rest of the 'platoon' are standing at the edge of the clearing. EDWARD is sitting casually on a fallen tree log with his shotgun across his knees. At his feet lays the four mens rifles. They sit in the middle of the clearing with their hands on their heads. They look nervous.\
Panel 3\
EDWARD, RICHARD and the SERGEANT stand off to one side of the clearing.\

\cf0 <$ScrKeepWithNext>EDWARD\
\pard\li2160\ri720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 They say they're Republican. Lost. I think deserters but they say not. Anything is possible I suppose.\
\pard\li3600\ri-360\sb240\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 <$ScrKeepWithNext>SERGEANT\
\pard\li2160\ri720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 What do we do with them? What do you think?\

\cf0 <$ScrKeepWithNext>EDWARD\
\pard\li2160\ri720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Apparently, they would like to come along with us.\
\pard\li3600\ri-360\sb240\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 <$ScrKeepWithNext>SERGEANT\
\pard\li2160\ri720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Hmm.\
\pard\li3600\ri-360\sb240\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 <$ScrKeepWithNext>RICHARD\
\pard\li2160\ri720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 We could do with the numbers.\
\pard\li3600\ri-360\sb240\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 <$ScrKeepWithNext>EDWARD\
\pard\li2160\ri720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 There is the patrol to deal with.\

\cf0 Panel 5\
\pard\li3600\ri-360\sb240\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 <$ScrKeepWithNext>SERGEANT\
\pard\li2160\ri720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 We'll take them along.\
\pard\li3600\ri-360\sb240\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 <$ScrKeepWithNext>RICHARD\
\pard\li2160\ri720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 They're an evil looking lot though.\
\pard\li720\ri-720\sl-240\sb240\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Panel 6\
The SERGEANT and the rest of the men are walking single file along the forest path. ANBESSA and EDWARD are bringing up the rear of the column. EDWARD is once again looking over his shoulder down the path.\
