PPANEL 1
SAUL and ISABEL stand at GRANDMOTHERS garden gate. GRANDMOTHER is in the foreground of the panel, bent low harvesting herbs in the garden. Half a dozen stringy black cats should also be visible in the panel - spread around. The GRANDMOTHER has not seen the two of them.
Panel 2
GRANDMOTHER is still bent low, facing the reader. Her head is still down. ISABEL is smiling. She knows her GRANDMOTHER is teasing SAUL. SAUL does not know this and looks a little unnerved.
GRANDMOTHER
So. You arrived then. Late, I see.
Panel 3
ISABEL is hugging her GRANDMOTHER. ISABEL is smiling widely. Her GRANDMOTHER is looking forbidding, but we can tell she is pleased to see ISABEL. She has a gentle hand on ISABELS cheek.
GRANDMOTHER (CONT'D)
That will do girl. Let me have a look at your man then.
Panel 4
GRANDMOTHER has her hand on SAULS cheek. Her thumb is dragging SAULS eye lid up and she is looking at SAULS white, bloodshot, eyeball very closely. SAUL looks non-plussed.
GRANDMOTHER (CONT'D)
Not ready yet.
Panel 5
GRANDMOTHER is checking SAULS teeth. She has both hands on SAULS face. Her index fingers are pushing SAULS top lip up. We see teeth and gums.
GRANDMOTHER (CONT'D)
Hmm...
Panel 6
The GRANDMOTHER is walking towards the reader. ISABEL and SAUL can be seen in the background of the panel. SAUL looks utterly confused. ISABEL looks unsettled. GRANDMOTHER looks grim faced and a little sad.
GRANDMOTHER (CONT'D)
Not ready. Not... at... all.

SAUL visits the bar on his own. He is chatting to a couple of the locals - who speak English. He is asking about the history of the village, any famous visitors (painters perhaps?) and ends by asking about the civil war. Atmosphere changes. Colder. No-one wants to talk about the civil war. SAUL apologises and changes the subject. </Text>

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. A MOUNTAIN PATH. ABOVE THE TREELINE.The men are seen walking single file uphill along a mountain path. The path leads back down to the treeline.

CAP
Three days march. No food. We cannot hunt. We need silence.

PANEL 2

The men are seen from the rear following the path as it climbs towards a small shepherds hut. A shepherd, an old man, is standing beside it looking down at the men. He is holding a shotgun in the crook of his arm.

PANEL 3

The men sit in a group eating meat cooked over an open fire. The shepherd is pouring wine from a wineskin into EDWARDs cup.

CAP
The old shepherd is happy to see us. His voice cracks with unfamiliar use.

EDWARD
Gracias. Abuelo.

CAP
He shares his food without thought and is uncomfortable with payment. A simple man in complicated times.

PANEL 4

The men are viewed walking down the path back towards the treeline. They are carrying supplies and many have wine and water skins over their shoulders. EDWARD has a shotgun over his shoulder and a pair of boots tied to his backpack.

PANEL 5

The shepherd is seen laying on the ground. He is dead. His throat has been cut. His boots are missing.

CAP
Something has shifted. Something inside me has fractured. The pieces move in the dark.

CAP
Richard senses it. A recognition of distance, my otherness. And there is fear.

Storm breaks - no rain - but lightning and thunder - violent. SAUL is still reading. It is getting dark, towards night and the storm is darkening the sky and the room. We should see the contrast between the 'big sky' and the small lamplit kitchen with the three people in it. SAUL reading, looking horrified. ISABEL with her hand on his shoulder and the GM doing domestic stuff. </Text>

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR. 1936. DAY. MEADOW. DEEP IN THE FOREST. The men walk through the lush green meadow. The men are seen from a low angle. Grass and wildflowers should make up the foreground with the men in the background. It is very hot. The sun is bright and the panel should have a high contrast between those areas that are sunlit and those in shade.

PANEL 2

RICHARD and EDWARD walk together. RICHARD is wiping his face with a hankerchief.

RICHARD
Calvino?

EDWARD
There's nothing to say, Richard... Look up ahead.

PANEL 3

We can see the backs of the men and beyond the men, we can see the rest of the meadow, and a rising forested slope up to the stone ramparted and gated walls of a village. The village walls look worn and half ruined but still solid.

PANEL 4

EXTERIOR. 1936. DAY. BRIDGE OVER MOAT. DEEP IN THE FOREST. The men approach the gate. They are standing on a stone bridge over a small and dirty moat. There are three beautiful, completely naked, young women, sitting high on the rampart walls over the open raised metals gate through the walls. They are holding large baskets of over-ripe fruit. The men are smiling, and wave as they approach.

PANEL 5

EXTERIOR. 1936. DAY. IN FRONT OF THE VILLAGE WALLS. DEEP IN THE FOREST. The women aggressively throw the over-ripe fruit down at the men. The men stand under a rain of rotten fruit, protecting themselves as best they can.

RICHARD
Why the devil are they throwing things at us!

SERGEANT
I don't know but run! Run through the gate!

PANEL 6

We see a rear view of the three women. Each has a large pair of bat-like wings. Two have folded wings, the other has open wings - like a heron flexing its wings. Their baskets are mostly empty. They look content. The men can be seen in the distance, walking down the road into the village. The women are looking at each other. Their eyes are now gone and their eyes are running with blood - just on their cheeks. (The wings and their bloody eyes are not visible in the previous panels).

THIRD WOMAN
I'm bored. What shall we do now?

Correcto.

PANEL 2

SAUL
Thanks for meeting me. I have some questions about the diary.

PANEL 3

ISABEL
Where does it come from?
SAUL
Yes. Predictable, I suppose.
ISABEL
It is my Grandmothers. She posted it to me last week, with a note asking me to give it to you.

PANEL 4

SAUL
Me? Specifically me? She had my address?
ISABEL
S¡.
SAUL
How does your Grandmother know me?
ISABEL
I don't know. Until last week I knew nothing of the diary.

PANEL 5

ISABEL
I will ask her when I go home next week. We holiday.
SAUL
Can't you call her?
ISABEL
She has no phone. She is a woman of... tradition.

PANEL 6

SAUL
A neighbour?
ISABEL
There is no phone in the village. It is -
SAUL
- traditional?.

Outrage in village. Storm the Town Hall. Burn all landownership documents in the village square. Edward views it with amusement - the dead boy was nothing to him. The burning is futile.</Text>

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. FOREST PATH. DEEP IN THE FOREST. EDWARD and the rest of the men are kneeling in the shadow of the trees at the edge of a clearing in the forest. They are all looking upwards into the sky. The men are dappled by the sunlight coming through through the tree foliage above them.

PANEL 2

CALVINO
The same?

SERGEANT
I believe so.

PANEL 3

RICHARD
Yes. You see the black discs on the wings? With the crosses? Edward, what are they called?

EDWARD
The crosses? St Andrews crosses. It's theirs... Definitely.

PANEL 4

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. THE SKY ABOVE THE FOREST. We see the underside of the bi-plane, (a Fokker VIIb3m - see http://www.zi.ku.dk/personal/drnash/model/spain/codes.html). It is set against a background of blue sky and clouds. No pilot is visible.

CALVINO
(off panel)
You think its something to do with that fascist patrol?

SERGEANT
(off panel)
It may be.

CALVINO
(off panel)
Looking just for us? The plane and the patrol? Both?

PANEL 5

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. FOREST PATH. DEEP IN THE FOREST. The men are looking at each other. They look solemn.

PPANEL 1
EXTERIOR: 2013. DAY. GRANDMOTHERS VINYARD.
SAUL and ISABEL stand between a long row of vines. They are in a field of vines - long symetrical parallel rows.
SAUL
Why did you leave, Isabel?
ISABEL
To live. To learn and see something of the world.
Panel 2
EXTERIOR: 2013. DAY. SURROUNDING HILLS.
SAUL and ISABEL are walking in  the hills around the vilage. We can see the village - on its own hill - in the background. SAUL and ISABEL are walking a dirt track - leading upwards.
SAUL
You intend to come back after your medical training?
ISABEL
Of course. I have roots in the soil.
Panel 3
EXTERIOR: 2013. DAY. FARM FIELD.
SAUL and ISABEL are crossing a farmers field. The field is full of sheep. They are walking towards the village, which we can see - up on its hill - in the background.
SAUL
This would be a wonderful place to paint. Did I tell you I am an Art Historian?
ISABEL
No. But this view has been painted. A long time ago.
Panel 4
EXTERIOR: 2013. DAY. VILLAGE STREETS.
SAUL
Who painted the view?
ISABEL
Someone my Grandmother knew.
SAUL
But that can't be right. It must have been 250 years ago.
Panel 5
ISABEL is looking at SAUL intently as they continue walking along the street. She is upset but is controlling it quietly.
Panel 6
ISABEL lays a hand on his arm as they walk. She is gentle.
ISABEL
Now, how would you know that?

Possibly pix Page 200 and 201 together. Panel by Panel - 1936 and 2013 together. Would be an interesting way to quicken the pace of the text and to tell the two stories at the same time. To show the connections through time of the two. 
Night - GM sits in the mud in front of Edward. The rain has stopped. He reaches for his pen and begins to write. She watches. Hours pass. It becomes morning - He gives her the diary. "Do you now of the... (Use Eddy Merx highlighted quote." He reached for his pistol and shoots himself through the mouth. We do not see it. We see the GM's stricken face and 'hear' the bang. </Text>

PANEL 4

The FERRY WOMAN stands beckoning at EDWARD.

FERRY WOMAN
You! ...Come here. And hold out your tongue.

PANEL 6

The men stand looking at the FERRY WOMAN's back as she walks off towards her home. They look puzzled and confused. EDWARD is holding the coin in his hand and frowning at it.

RICHARD
Thank you for helping us.

FERRY WOMAN
Is that what you think I did?

ISABEL
You must have dreamt that.

PANEL 6

SAUL
Pity. I would have liked that... very much.

PANEL 7

ISABEL has lent forward and has taken SAULS face in her hands. She is kissing him.

Saul?... Saul? Where are you?

PANEL 2

SAUL is swimming naked in the lake. His eyes are closed and he is swimming with a purpose. He is enjoying it.

PANEL 3

SAUL swims as if in a dream. Now he is not alone. A naked woman swims with him, under him, dolphin-like, leaving a trail of light in her wake. He cannot see her.

PANEL 4

ISABEL sits by the side of the lake and watches him swim. She is smiling gently.

ISABEL
Ah, la Donna del Agua... Pero tiene un corazon puro y mi proteccion, mi senora.

PANEL 5

ISABEL is looking at the neatly folded pile of SAULS clothes. She smiles mischievously.

PANEL 6

Huh?

We'll camp for the night soon. Mateo, scout ahead and find us a good spot.

MATEO
Yes, Jefe.

PANEL 5

PACO
He calls you Jefe? Not very revolutionary. It should be comrade.

SERGEANT
He is being ironical. Comedic even.

PANEL 6

PACO
I don't find it funny. Not the right amount of revolutionary zeal I think.

SERGEANT
Hmm. Yes well, right now, to me you're a revolutionary zealot whose commitment made him a deserter from the peoples army... I'd be careful about voicing your opinion.

SERGEANT
Eduardo, a moment please, in private.

PANEL 7

EDWARD and the SERGEANT are stood together talking while the rest of the column is 20 or so yards ahead on the forest path.

SERGEANT
We need to talk about the patrol following us.

A succession of scenes of Saul in pubs - different pubs. He looks progressively worse in each. He is talking crap and getting aggressive. Panel 4 should show him being launched out onto the pavement by club bouncers. He should land on his face. Panel 5 should show him, very unkempt now, staggering along the road with a cut face - drenched from the rain. Panel 6 should show him, from behind, at his garden gate... Looking at Isabel sitting on his front door step, in the rain.

Injured man arrives and is cared for. Partly by straight medicine. The taking of 'medicine' and addition of poltices etc. Then the two women are visited by another older woman. Older than GM.The three women then carry out a ceremony of some sort. The room becomes full of 'shades' / 'presences'. Darkness and light. Research this. It should still feel domestic though. The things used in the ceremony should be kitchen utensils etc. It should take a night and a day. The passage of time should be shown somehow. At the end of it it should be apparent that the man is weak but will live. SAUL should sleep through some of it. </Text>

Family meal in the garden of GM's house. GM is behaving like Pilar in Hemingway. Teasing him by being severe. ISABEL is rolling her eyes at GM. We should however, be aware that the GM is working on two levels with SAUL as we know of their last conversation, but ISABEL does not. Want to get the sense of two conversations happening at the same time with the same words.

All I'm asking is that you don't go to Spain... now.

EDWARD
People are dying there. And I have to tell their stories.

CLARA
Don't be so pompous Edward. We only married three months ago. I need you here... Its... important.

PANEL 1

SAUL and ISABEL stand at GRANDMOTHERS garden gate. GRANDMOTHER is in the foreground of the panel, bent low harvesting herbs in the garden. Half a dozen stringy black cats should also be visible in the panel - spread around. The GRANDMOTHER has not seen the two of them.

PANEL 2

GRANDMOTHER is still bent low, facing the reader. Her head is still down. ISABEL is smiling. She knows her GRANDMOTHER is teasing SAUL. SAUL does not know this and looks a little unnerved.

GRANDMOTHER
So. You arrived then. Late, I see.

PANEL 3

ISABEL is hugging her GRANDMOTHER. ISABEL is smiling widely. Her GRANDMOTHER is looking forbidding, but we can tell she is pleased to see ISABEL. She has a gentle hand on ISABELS cheek.

GRANDMOTHER (CONT'D)
That will do girl. Let me have a look at your man then.

PANEL 4

GRANDMOTHER has her hand on SAULS cheek. Her thumb is dragging SAULS eye lid up and she is looking at SAULS white, bloodshot, eyeball very closely. SAUL looks non-plussed.

GRANDMOTHER (CONT'D)
Not ready yet.

PANEL 5

GRANDMOTHER is checking SAULS teeth. She has both hands on SAULS face. Her index fingers are pushing SAULS top lip up. We see teeth and gums.

GRANDMOTHER (CONT'D)
Hmm...

PANEL 6

The GRANDMOTHER is walking towards the reader. ISABEL and SAUL can be seen in the background of the panel. SAUL looks utterly confused. ISABEL looks unsettled. GRANDMOTHER looks grim faced and a little sad.

GRANDMOTHER (CONT'D)
Not ready. Not... at... all.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. DEEP IN THE FOREST.

CAP
Richard is unsettled. He has kept his distance as we walk. He is wrestling with my conscience.

PANEL 2

CAP
Aristotle wrote that a person is formed from his actions. Repeated, these actions become habits that set into character. I don't disagree...

RICHARD
Edward. How could you do that?

PANEL 3

CAP
In India, as a child, I saw a English Officer make a native lie down in the street and rub his own nose in the dust and the dirt.

PANEL 4

CAP
His crime was neglecting to salaam when the Officer approached.

RICHARD
Edward. Answer me.

PANEL 5

CAP
Others were whitewashed or made to wriggle along a stretch of public road on their stomachs... The infamous 'crawling order'.

CAP
Is it in our interest to seem moral but not to be moral? I feel no guilt, though I know it is expected. I have a weapon and new boots. I am simply glad for that.

PANEL 6

CAP
I cannot explain this to Richard. He is a better man than I. He would not understand.

EDWARD
Edward, let it lie... please.

GM is running through the trees. Edward is chasing her, hunting her. He is a few yards behind her when her shoe falls off. Without thinking he bends and picks it up. She has backed up to a tree - the suicide tree. He has a moment of clarity - of realization - as he stands holding out her shoe to the GM. He looks around - horrified at what is being done and his part in it.</Text>

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: DAY. 1936. FOREST PATH. IN THE FOREST. The men are walking downhill through the trees towards a riverbank.

PANEL 2

The men stand in a group by the side of the river. The river is not wide and is not deep. ANBESSA is fording the river - testing whether it is too deep to cross. It is up to his waist.

PANEL 3

ANBESSA has reached almost to the other side. He stands knee deep in the water. He is waving the rest onward.

ANBESSA
Come on in. But mind your balls. It is damn cold!

PANEL 4

EXTERIOR: DAY. 1936. FAR BANK OF THE RIVER. GM is standing on the other side of the river. She has one hand on her hips and in the other is full of herbs. She has a bag slung across her shoulder from one side to the other. More plants can be seen poking up out of the top of the bag.

GRANDMOTHER
Hey! Mind your language! There's a lady present!

ANBESSA
What! Oh sorry! I didn't see...know...

PANEL 5

The men are standing on the bank laughing. They can be seen in the background. Our viewpoint is from behind GM. ANBESSA can be seen, still standing in the water, looking wide eyed and surprised.

GRANDMOTHER
Fine lot of soldiers you are. A handful of children with rifles could have killed you!

PANEL 6

ANBESSA
We're heading for the village up on the hill.

GRANDMOTHER
I know. I'll take you.

ANBESSA
How do you know we're safe?

GRANDMOTHER
I know you're not. But I have my role to play.

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. DEEP FOREST

CAP
We saw our first dead fascist today. He was propped against a tree trunk and looked to have been there for a few days. We stared.

CAP
A pornographic magazine had been placed in his lap and a cigarette hung casually from his mouth. Flies swarmed over him in a cloud. On his hat sat a coil of human excrement.

PANEL 4

CAP
Richard came to his senses first. He turned away and knelt, retching.

RICHARD
Oh Holy God!

PANEL 5

CAP
As for me, I felt only two things. That I was glad to be alive. And, God forgive me, amusement. Inside I was laughing.

CAP
Of horror, I felt nothing. I do not know why.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. MOUNTAIN PATH. ABOVE THE TREELINE. MOUNTAINS. EDWARD and the other men sit looking at a distant mountain top. On the mountain top there is what looks like an abbey, (google image Monte Cassino and World War 2). There are great gouts of smoke rising from the abbey and its showing signs of damage from bombing. A handful of planes are visible in the air above it

PANEL 2

The men look saddened and, for some reason, a little guilty.

CALVINO
Madre. I pity those under that.

PANEL 3

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. SKY ABOVE THE ABBEY. MOUNTAINS. We see the abbey from above. A plane is diving down towards it, ready to release another bomb.

PANEL 4

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. MOUNTAIN PATH. ABOVE THE TREELINE. MOUNTAINS.

RICHARD
What is that place? What value has it? Why would they bomb?

MATEO
It is a retreat,  a library of sorts. At least I think so. I don't know for sure.

PANEL 5

RICHARD is horrified. The idea of destroying a library is offending him almost as much as the idea that there are people under that bombing.

RICHARD
We should go up there and see if we can help!

PANEL 6

EDWARD is laying on his back on the ground. He is enjoying the rest. RICHARD is standing, looking at him...  He looks confused and numb.

EDWARD
They're dead Richard. They're already dead. What would be the point?

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 2005. DAY. RAINING. MUDDY RUGBY PITCH. LOCAL RUGBY CLUB. SAUL is tackling an opposition player. The tackle is a strong one and the both players are grimacing from the hit. They, like any other rugby players seen on this page, should be smeared with mud.

CAP
My guilt weeps and bleeds. A dead thing come to life.

PANEL 2

INTERIOR: 2005. DAY. HOTEL ROOM. CONFERENCE. OSLO. SAUL is lying naked on his back on the bed. The semi-clothed PROSTITUTE is placing a condom on his penis.

PANEL 3

EXTERIOR: 2005. DAY. RAINING. MUDDY RUGBY PITCH. LOCAL RUGBY CLUB. We see a close up of the left hand side of the scrum. SAUL is in the loose head prop position so his face is the one nearest to the reader and is the only one that is clearly defined. The others are partial or mostly in shadow. The effort on the faces should be visible.

CAP
I welcome a measured pain. A punishment not quite worthy of the crime. But a punishment none the less.

PANEL 4

INTERIOR: 2005. DAY. HOTEL ROOM. CONFERENCE. OSLO. SAUL and the PROSTITUTE are having sex. She is sitting astride him.

CAP
I feel the brush of fresh fingertips against my arm, my throat, my thighs. Illicit... over-ripe and blue-green bruised.

PANEL 5

EXTERIOR: 2005. DAY. RAINING. MUDDY RUGBY PITCH. LOCAL RUGBY CLUB. A line out viewed from the touchline. SAUL is third from the front on the right hand side of the panel. He should look expectant. The ball is in the air, between the two rows of men.

CAP
Our married faces, sour and bloated in each days light, know a truth yet recognised.

PANEL 6

INTERIOR: 2005. DAY. HOTEL ROOM. CONFERENCE. OSLO. The PROSTITUTE is kneeling on the bed. SAUL has entered her from behind. Her face should be large in the left hand side of the panel. She should look disengaged - not bored, but professional. SAUL should have the same expression on his face as he did in Panel 1.

CAP
In my sleep I heard a mother wolf and woke gulping and wet cheeked.

CAP
We are broken and disfigured... down here, playing in the muck.

PANEL 1

INTERIOR: 2013. NIGHT. FERRY WOMANS HOUSE. RIVER BANK. DEEP IN THE FOREST. ISABEL standing by the side of SAULS bed. She is naked, looking down at him in the bed. He is delerious and blind to anything around him.

PANEL 2

The panel should take up the majority of the page. SAUL is having a surreal delerium dream of, (in no particular order and in the form of a mixed montage/collage): the forest; his bed; FRANCISCO as a young man in his twenties; a dark painting;  SAULS violently beating KATE; FRANCISCOS witch painting; war scenes from EDWARDS story; the she-wolf in soldiers clothing; a forest sex scene with two men and a woman - all naked, (one man has a leopards mask face, one a lion mask, and the woman has the she-wolfs face mask); three women flying around a rampart with red bloody eyes, the dead shepherd, a murder of crows, a church enthusiastically on fire, a tree with multiple bodies hanging from it, FRANCISCO's carriage with a broken wheel and a middle aged FRANCISCO standing by it, ISABELS Grandmother as a young woman and an old woman. SAULS and ISABELS both holding hands with their five year old daughter. Future and past scenes from stories in the novel. It should be mixed up and should not make sense.

PANEL 3

INTERIOR: 2013. DAY. FERRY WOMANS HOUSE. RIVER BANK. DEEP IN THE FOREST. SAUL and ISABEL sleep side by side in the bed, naked from the waist up. Quiet and content. His fever has broken.

PANEL 4

EXTERIOR: 2013. DAY. FERRY WOMANS HOUSE. RIVER BANK. DEEP IN THE FOREST. ISABEL and the FERRY WOMAN are standing outside the house. Each is holding a coffee cup. SAUL is sleeping.

FERRY WOMAN
He looks better. More peaceful.

ISABEL
I believe so. I think we'll be leaving in a day or so.

A close up of the upper part of SAULS face. His eyes are wide open.

PANEL 3

A close up of the lower part of SAULS face. He has a huge, closed lipped, smile on his face.

PANEL 4

From above we see SAUL and ISABEL laying naked side by side on the forest floor. He is on his back with his right arm under his own head. His left arm is around ISABEL. She is laying on her side facing him. Her arm is across his chest. She is asleep. He is looking very pleased with himself.

PANEL 5

ISABEL and SAUL are pottering around the campsite. SAUL is watching her out of the corner of his eye.

PANEL 6

SAUL is sat in front of the camp fire, holding a cup of coffee. He is facing us. ISABEL is standing behind him. She is casually and gently slapping him around the back of his head. She is smiling indulgently.

SAUL

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. HEAVY RAIN. DEEP IN THE FOREST. The men huddle under whatever cover they can get from the trees.

CALVINO
We have marched for a week. Have we lost our way?

SERGEANT
It is possible. Though we move in the right direction.

PANEL 2

SERAFIN
How far to the next village?

MATEO
The man said we were lost.

PANEL 3

CALVINO
Possibly lost. And with no food.

PANEL 4

SERGEANT
Fifty or so km's. If we are on the right track.

CALVINO
I can't march that far without something to eat.

PANEL 5

We see EDWARD sitting, his legs straight out with the soles of his boots prominent in the panel. He has his shotgun cradled in his folded arms.

EDWARD
We should find another shepherd.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1760. DAY. VALLADOLID, SPAIN. FRANCISCO DE ABRIL Y BAREA steps down from a wagon into a busy market square. A large bearded man is sat on the 'driving seat'. He is a bear of a man.

UNCLE
What the fuck is that God be damned smell?

FRANCISCO
Pigs, Uncle.

PANEL 2

We can see a back view of FRANCISCO and his Uncle standing in front of a building. It is a good sized home, with an imposing entrance. But it has gone a little to seed... unkempt.

PANEL 3

FRANCISCO
Do you think he is home?

PANEL 4

The same view as Panel 2.

UNCLE

One side of his shirt front in his trousers and the other out. He is soaked from the rain. At the other end of his path is a dark haired elfin girl. She is sitting on his doorstep. She sits under her umbrella, holding a book.

SAUL
Are you here to kill me?

ISABEL
I only kill people when the sun shines.

PANEL 2

SAUL
Pity. I think I might benefit from it.

Saul looks sorry for himself.

SAUL

Child comes to door. Agricultural accident. Injured man who has been caught in a machine. Being brought to GM's house. GM and ISABEL start preparations.

As he speaks his face should show the same deformity as the bandits in EDWARDS story. GM says "You are not resolved, not redeemed. You are as sick as when you began." SAUL notices ISABEL in the doorway. She is looking at him in a horrified way SAUL starts to go to her. GM says "Stay there!". GM slams down another diary on the kitchen table in front of him.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1760. DAY. PIG STY. ATILIO'S HOUSE. VALLADOLID. FRANCISCO is standing in the middle of the pig sty. He is scraping pig shit into a loose pile in one corner. GABRIEL stands on the outside of the sty leaning on its fence with his arms folded.

GABRIEL
Now boy... The oldest Mediterranean civilizations, the Greeks, Romans and Egyptians have extensively used painting techniques based on mixtures of encaustic, likely rich in bee wax, mineral pigments such as iron, and tempera.

FRANCISCO
Yes Master.

PANEL 2

GABRIEL is pointing a finger upwards to give emphasis to his point. FRANCISCO is still shovelling shit.

GABRIEL
You know tempera? Francisco. No? Incredible! It is a fluid mixture of binder, water and vegetable oils.

FRANCISCO
Yes Master.

PANEL 3

GABRIEL has his hands clasped behind his back and is pacing from the left of the panel to the right. He is concentrating on his 'speech'. Behind him FRANCISCO is shovelling.

GABRIEL
At the end of the Roman Empire and up to the 15th century, this ancient technique was lost...

FRANCISCO
So why are...?

GABRIEL
...so now oil paint became what we artists use. Yes? But it has been a long journey. In Italy and Greece, olive oil was used. But the drying time was excessively long.

GABRIEL
One could not get our patrons to sit still long enough. Eh? No, not at all.

FRANCISCO
Yes Master.

PANEL 4

GABRIEL has his hands clasped behind his back and is pacing from the right of the panel to the left. Behind him FRANCISCO is shovelling.

GABRIEL
Now, about 1410, Jan Van Eyck, Flemish but still a good painter,  developed a stable varnish based on linseed oil as the binder of mineral pigments.

GABRIEL
His secret was a mixture of piled glass, calcined bones and mineral pigments in linseed oil, maintained for a long time in a viscous state at boiling temperature. You understand? Francisco?

FRANCISCO
Yes Master.

PANEL 5

GABRIEL has his hands clasped behind his back and is pacing from the left of the panel to the right. Behind him FRANCISCO is shovelling.

GABRIEL
Now Francisco. After Van Eyck, Antonello da Messina introduced a new improvement. He cleverly added a lead oxide to the pigment-oil mixtures to increase their siccative property. Impressive, yes?

FRANCISCO
Yes Master. Very.

PANEL 6

We see Gabriels back as he walks away from the sty. The left part of the panel is filled with FRANCISCO's face. He looks resigned.

GABRIEL
Enough for today! But there is more, much more! A world of beauty!

FRANCISCO
Yes Master.

GABRIEL
And don't miss the shit in the corners. Get it all out.

FRANCISCO
Yes Master.

SERAFIN
Wake up. We have trouble.

PANEL 2

Face off between TRISTÁNs and SERGEANTs men. CALVINO is being held by TRISTÁN and another man. SERAFIN makes a small shrug. In his mind he has already jettisoned CALVINO. SERAFIN speaks quietly to EDWARD.

SERAFIN
The big man caught Calvino making the beast with two backs with his wife. He demands some blood.

PANEL 3

TRISTÁN holds a large wicked looking hunting knife. It shines in the firelight.

TRISTÁN
You! Get the fuck out! Everyone. He stays.

SERGEANT
I won't leave him.

TRISTÁN
Then you all stay. Like the dead stay.

PANEL 6

INTERIOR: 1936. NIGHT. CAVE. ABOVE THE TREELINE. MOUNTAINS. TRISTÁN is holding the long sharp hunting knife. CALVINO is cowering in the corner of the cave looking very frightened. TRISTÁNs wife is also advancing towards CALVINO holding a knife. The other men are standing around. All the faces, other than CALVINOs, should be distorted in the same way as Panel 6 of PAGE 76. They should look greedy, and selfish, but should not look like they are enjoying it.

SAUL jumps to his feet. He cannot stand the heat. He cannot stand the things he is reading. "I must move... Must get outside!" He stands in the garden and has the book open in his hands. He is looking at the church - wide eyed. In the background the GM and ISABEL are standing in the doorway of the house. He starts walking towards it.

PANEL 1

INTERIOR. 1936. DAY. BAR. VILLAGE. The men stand next to the fountain which is in the centre of the plaza. They are drinking wine. The mood is subdued. The strangeness of the proceedings in the village has worried them. The priest is still with them. He is very drunk.

SERAFIN
So what now, jefe?

SERGEANT
There is nothing we can do here? I think we gather supplies and move on.

PANEL 2

RICHARD

SERGEANT
Yes.

FATHER RAMON
Yes. What is it?

MATEO
Father, it is the year of our Lord, 1936.

PANEL 6

FATHER RAMON
Is that all?

RICHARD
Er... Yes.

FATHER RAMON
Then I have been here four hundred and twelve years.

PANEL 7

The men quickly draw the conclusion that FATHER RAMON is crazy. It brings out a little compassion in the Spaniards, though not in EDWARD.

SERAFIN
Come Father. Sit down on the ground. You are tired.

FATHER RAMON
Yes. Yes I am. Bless you.

EDWARD
We need to leave. You remember there is a patrol behind us?

SERGEANT
Yes. I remember.

The panel should stretch the width of the page. Our view is from a rooftop looking down into the street. We are looking down upon the men while the walk along the street. We are looking over the shoulders of the three eyeless, winged, women. One of the womens hands rests on a roof tile. Next to it we can see the shape of a line. It is the same as the lion carved into the tree trunk by Anbessa.
Panel 4
EXTERIOR: NIGHT TO DAY. 1936. VILLAGE STREET.
The panel should stretch the width of the page. The men are seen in a single line - we see the right hand profile. The left of the panel should be night, and as the eye travels along the width of the panel, it should become day.</Text>

PANEL 1

INTERIOR: 2007. DAY. RELATE MARRIAGE GUIDANCE OFFICE. SAUL and KATE sit in a slightly shabby room. The room has a skylight window - it was at one time the attic in an Edwardian middle class house. On the walls are public sector posters about saving energy by turning lightbulbs off and a few dog-eared office printed notices promoting relationship happiness and compromise. This is public sector marriage guidance - no frills. SAUL and KATE sit beside each other on the kind of chairs you find in Doctors waiting rooms. Across from them sits JENNIFER - a marriage guidance counseller. A coffee table seperates them. On it sits three coffee cups - one a porcelain mug and two plastic dispenser cups. A vase of droopy, dying, flowers tops off the feeling of failure that the room exudes.

CAP
I knew that it was not going to be alright as soon as I saw the room. No relationship came back from the brink here.

PANEL 2

CAP
The Counseller - Jennifer - dislikes me. As she tells us she will be impartial and objective, I can tell she wants to see me neutered...

CAP
...with something blunt.

PANEL 3

CAP
She likes Kate. They bond. Against me. Against the resistant, embarrassed men that disappoint Jennifer daily in this room.

PANEL 4

CAP
I don't blame her. We're an unfortunate bunch. Brought to her as a last resort.

PANEL 5

SAUL has a notebook open on his knee. We see that he has drawn a turkey looking at a Christmas tree.

CAP
I squirm as my wife describes her infidelity. They look at me in tacit sisterhood. I, flacid and impotent, sit waiting for the hour to end. The first of six spendthrift hours we will spend here.

PANEL 6

CAP
In the car, on the way home, Kate will tick off the appointment in her diary. A spic and span end to our ragged day.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 2013. NIGHT. VILLAGE SQUARE. EDWARD and RICHARD are strolling across the village square.

RICHARD
Which bar? Hob-nobbing or slumming?

EDWARD
Both. I'm in the mood for a gutful.

PANEL 2

INTERIOR: NIGHT. 1936. VILLAGE BAR. RICH BAR. The hidalgos of the village are seated at the bar tables. The local police chief and the Priest are also in the bar, seated with the bosses. Two of them are looking back over their shoulder at RICHARD and EDWARD as they enter the bar.

PANEL 3

RICHARD and EDWARD are sitting sharing wine at a table. They are looking up at two standing men. One is pulling back a chair in preparation to sit down. He is a tall man, almost funereal, dressed in a sombre black suit. The other stands primly with his hands behind his back. He is a short portly man, well dressed in a white suit.

TALL MAN
May we sit Gentlemen?

PANEL 4

SHORT MAN
They are children you know. Most need guidance and direction. It has always been this way.

EDWARD
The villagers?

TALL MAN
Yes, our villagers. Sheep to be herded, but cared for dutifully.

PANEL 5

RICHARD
And how dutiful are you?

SHORT MAN
Within our means we are good shepherds. We provide land for work and homes for their children.

EDWARD
At a price, of course.

SHORT MAN
A very reasonable one. Naturally, we require a payment. Sheep must be sheared, however gently it is done.

PANEL 6

RICHARD is looking across the bar. He has his hand raised, trying to attract the attention of the waiter who is serving a table in the background. EDWARD is looking attentively at the SHORT MAN. He has a cynical smile on his face.

RICHARD
I think I need more wine. A great deal more.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. NIGHT. ON THE RIVER. DEEP IN THE FOREST. The boat is moving slowly through the water. The river seems wide. There is some mist on the water. Small patches of wake are seen around the tips of the oars as they breach the water.

PANEL 2

RICHARD
How long will the crossing take?

PANEL 3

The old woman looks sardonic. She waves a hand at the far river bank.

FERRY WOMAN
As long as it takes. Do you dislike my dreary coast?

PANEL 4

CALVINO's hand trails over the side of the boat and his fingers dip into the water.

FERRY WOMAN
You might want to reconsider that my friend.

PANEL 5

Dark shapes can be seen in the water around the boat. The moonlight does not allow us to see what they are, but occasionally the broad back of something breaks the surfaces for a moment.

PANEL 6

The men look nervously at the water around the boat. Calvino has moved his hand from the water.

FERRY WOMAN
Settle down. You lot are more dangerous than anything out there.

FERRY WOMAN
Well, one of you is anyway.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. VILLAGE STREETS. The men are walking through the morning streets. Villagers are walking past them. The villagers look a little nervous of the armed men.

PANEL 2

The panel should take up almost the whole page. It should show a montage of daytime village scenes... The good things that people do... A Blacksmith, Shopkeeper, Potter, Teacher and Priest going about their work. Lots of smiling faces.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. FOREST PATH. DEEP IN THE FOREST. EDWARD is high in a tree overlooking the clearing (PAGE 62). He is hidden from view from the clearing.

PANEL 2

A man emerges from the trees on the other side of the clearing. He holds his rifle at waist height. He is looking for tracks on the ground.

PANEL 3

The man is kneeling on all fours. He is sniffing about a foot from the ground.

PANEL 4

We see EDWARDS face. He is looking surprised and shocked.

PANEL 5

The clearing area around the man is seen from above. The man is capering around on all fours, sniffing the ground. We can see the figure of eight path made in the flattened tall grass.

PANEL 6

Side view of the man. We can see his head, (which is pointing towards the viewer), his shoulder and his right hand. He is the she-wolf. His face is the wolfs. His hand is a paw. He is still clothed - the clothes hang loose as they are mansize - and there is a weapon across his back.

PANEL 7

EDWARD is running quickly through the trees. He looks panicked and frightened.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: DAY. 1936. FOREST PATH. IN THE FOREST.

SERGEANT
Quiet. They are coming.

PANEL 2

Side view of the enemy patrol walking through the trees. The 'wolfman' is not in sight. They look unsuspecting.

PANEL 3

We see the SERGEANT shouting.

SERGEANT
Fire!

PANEL 4

We see the SERGEANT and the other men picking through the bodies of the enemy patrol, looking for weapons and ammunition. The enemy are all dead.

PANEL 5

EDWARD is looking off into the trees to his left. He can see the 'wolfman' leaning casually against a tree with his arms crossed. He is smiling sardonically.

PANEL 6

We see a front view of EDWARD with his shotgun raised to his shoulder. He does not fire. His face should look puzzled.

EDWARD
But...?

PANEL 6

We see the same scene as Panel 4. This time it is seen over EDWARDS shoulder. The 'wolfman' is missing from the scene. Everything else should be the same.

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS. The men walk single file. In the background we can see the priest still sitting on the ground next to the fountain.

PANEL 2

EXTERIOR:1936. NIGHT. IN THE FOREST. We see a fox caught in a wire loop snare. The snare is around the animals back leg and the fox is gnawing at the wire.

PANEL 3

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. THE SKY ABOVE THE FOREST. A plane in the sky. It is the plane that is hunting them.

PANEL 4

EXTERIOR: 1936. NIGHT. VILLAGE PLAZA. The panel should take up most of the page. It should be at the least the full width of the page. The priest still sits on the ground. The three young women with the bloody eye-sockets and the bat wings sit around him. One kneels on the ground next to him. The others sit behind him, on the side of the fountain in the plaza. To the other side of the priests sits the she-wolf. They stare at the reader as if positioned for a family photograph from the early 20th century. The priest is crying. They are lit by the flames coming from the buildings on all sides of the plaza. The village is on fire.

PANEL 5

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. FOREST PATH. IN THE FOREST. We see the patrol that is searching for Edward and the rest of the men. The patrol is walking single file. Prominent in the panel should be the rear view of the back/shoulder of one of the soldiers. On it should hang the snare trap we saw in panel 2 above. We should not see the fox though. The snare should be a symbol of the hunt.

PANEL 6

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. FOREST PATH. IN THE FOREST. We see Edward looking back over his shoulder towards us. The rest of the men move in single file along the path ahead of him. He looks concerned.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. MOUNTAIN PATH. ABOVE THE TREELINE. MOUNTAINS. The men walk in line. Both men carrying PIETER wear face cloths. PIETER is delirious.

PIETER
...kill me... Don't kill me... I don't want to leave...

PANEL 2

The men have stopped to rest. PIETER lays on the stretcher on the ground. SERAFIN sits nearby holding his hands over his ears. The rest huddle together a few paces away. They all look unsettled. EDWARD stands off on his own. Looking back down the path. He does not look unsettled by PIETER.

CAP
By the afternoon Pieter simply screams. Moment after moment, his voice cracking and hoarse. Over and over.

PANEL 3

PIETERS stretcher lays on the floor. EDWARD kneels on one knee next to PIETER. PIETER looks at him wild eyed.

PIETER
Yes, you are one of his children. I know it. You can speak on my behalf in the hot place.

EDWARD
Quiet man. It must be. Accept it.

PANEL 4

PIETER
The last words. The benediction. Please.

EDWARD
There is no God. You are done. Accept it I say.

PIETER
Then there is no hell?

EDWARD
I do not say that. Consider this world before you leave it. Draw your conclusion.

PANEL 5

EDWARD lays on PIETERS body. Puts his hands over PIETERS mouth and nose. PIETERS arms and legs flail. PIETERS eyes are wide open and look shocked. It is not a gentle end.

PANEL 6

They cover the body with stones. Everyone but Edward is placing stones. No-one will look at Edward.

EDWARD
What? Look at me. I have done what  you would not. So look at me!

INTERIOR: DAY. 1988. SAULS LIVING ROOM. SAUL is standing holding a phone. He is looking angry and a little sick and sad.

SAUL
A month? Just one month? And you're moving the bugger in already?

PANEL 2

SAUL is pouring himself a drink. He is agitated.

SAUL
All the things I did... And put up with! And then she moves him into the house...

SAUL
...into my house, with my kids.

PANEL 3

EXTERIOR: DAY. 1988. SAULS BACK GARDEN. SAUL walks in his garden, holding a drink and speaks out loud to himself.

SAUL
...the potential impact on the children...

SAUL
...it's not right, or decent...

PANEL 4

INTERIOR: DAY. 1988. SAULS BATHROOM. SAUL is standing in his bathroom. He has a drink in one hand. He is looking in to the mirror and is speaking to his image. He looks truculant.

SAUL
...I may not have been the best husband...

SAUL
...and God knows, she was a poor wife...

PANEL 5

INTERIOR: DAY. 1988. SAULS LIVING ROOM. SAUL is pacing up and down his living room. He is looking increasingly angry and petulant. He is holding a drink. Some of it is spilling over the top of the glass as he walks.

SAUL
...I don't deserve it. I put up with all her crap, and for what?

PANEL 6

INTERIOR: DAY. 1988. SAULS HALL. SAUL is putting his coat on, using only one arm. He reaches for his car keys with his other hand. They are on the hallway table. He looks sad, but a little vicious.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. HIGH IN THE MOUNTAINS. OBSERVATION TRENCH.

CAP
When the morning mist in the valley clears, the air in the valley below is so soaked in dew that it resembles the sea. The sun makes it luminous green and yellow.. This is a beautiful place. 

RICHARD
I can't see anyone.

EDWARD
We can never see anyone. They're too far away to hit us.

PANEL 2

RICHARD
So why do they shoot at us?

EDWARD
Same reason we shoot at them. To remind ourselves there's a war on. Justifies the fuss and bother.

PANEL 3

Down on the valley floor men continue to farm. EDWARD and RICHARD watch the farmers, harvesting, creating food to sustain new life while on either side of the valley others contemplated the taking of it.

PANEL 4

RICHARD
Odd. The way they potter on regardless... you know, in spite of all this.

EDWARD
Easier to endure adversity than escape it, I suppose.

RICHARD
I find it reassuring.

PANEL 5

EDWARD
Speaking of enduring, I have to pay a visit. Loo paper?

RICHARD
After three weeks in this bloody trench... very amusing.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. MOUNTAIN PATH. ABOVE THE TREELINE. MOUNTAINS. Approaching a cave where TRISTÁN and the rest of his men live. The cave entrance is below a rock overhang.

PANEL 2

INTERIOR: 1936. DAY. CAVE. ABOVE THE TREELINE. MOUNTAINS. The men walk single file into the cave. They are seen from inside the cave. The inner cave is twenty feet or so from the outer entrance. A blanket covers the inner entrance and acts as a kind of door to the inner cave. The men are lit by the fire within the inner cave, which we cannot see.

PANEL 3

EDWARD points out the paintings on the wall to RICHARD. TRISTÁNs wife is beautiful, sensual curves and long curly black hair. She is greeting TRISTÁN and the other men.

CALVINO
Madre! Look at her. What breasts! What thighs!

SERAFIN
What guns! What knives! Idiota.

PANEL 4

TRISTÁN WIFE
Warm yourself by the fire. Food is coming.

PANEL 5

TRISTÁNs wife is spooning food into huge bowls. She is giving a bowl to CALVINO. He is looking at her in an overtly lustful way. TRISTÁNs wife is doing the same back. TRISTÁN has his back to them and is busy doing something on the other side of the cave. The cave is full of stacked food and barrels. A long table stretches along the side of the cave. It is piled high with food and looks like a butchers table. From the ceiling hang cured hams, sausages, pheasants, pigeons and rabbits.

PANEL 6

The men are eating food from the large bowls. TRISTÁNs men They using large spoons and the food is dripping from the sides of their mouths. There should be something off about their faces - they should be slightly malformed. Mouths slightly distorted. They should be taking no pleasure in the food and their eyes should be black - no whites around the pupils. TRISTÁNs wife has her hand on CALVINOs arm. She is flirting - with her eyes. He is very receptive.

TRISTÁN WIFE
Eat. It is my pleasure.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. NIGHT. RIVER BANK. DEEP IN THE FOREST. EDWARD and the other men are standing by the side of a wide river. Pieter lays on the stretcher on the ground. By the side of the river is a post and attached to it by a metal self and a thick chain is a bell, its clapper hanging down below it.

CALVINO
Like I said, the boatmans cottage is on the other side. See the light from the fire?

PANEL 2

SERAFIN
It is a risk.

SERGEANT
Agreed. But the river is too wide to swim. And with Pieter... Anbessa, ring the bell.

PANEL 3

Anbessa stands ringing the bell. The background is a moonlit river stretching out to the other shore. The boatmans home is lit from the fire. The moon should be full and reflected in the water.

PANEL 4

Rear view of a row-boat big enough to carry the seven men. A figure is in the middle of the boat. It is rowing. It should be wearing a hooded cloak and be indistinct in the moonlight. You should not be able to discern its sex.

PANEL 5

RICHARD and EDWARD are standing looking out towards the boat. The boat should be visible in the background... Its prow pointing towards the men.

RICHARD
He's coming.

PANEL 6

EDWARDS face should be squinting slightly as he looks out towards the boat.

EDWARD
Actually, I think 'he' may be a 'she'.

I feel a little grubby after that conversation.
EDWARD
Shall we drink with the proletariat for a while?
RICHARD
We shall.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
An odd couple, don't you think?

I quite liked them. At least they were honest.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAWN. FOREST PATH. DEEP IN THE FOREST. EDWARD is walking alone along a forest path.

CAP
I cannot sleep, so I walk. The sky is getting lighter, even among the dark trees.

PANEL 2

CAP
It is quiet and lonely. I feel cut off from everything and everyone here.

CAP
I follow the path towards the river. My thoughts drift as I walk.

PANEL 3

A rotund young Fascist soldier sits with his back to a tree, eating a hunk of brown bread.

PANEL 4

CAP
I stand for a few moments watching him. The bread crumbles in his hands and he leans forward to pick up the shards fallen to the ground.
CAP
I don't know what to do. I think I might tiptoe into the trees and find my way back.

PANEL 5

CAP
He turns and sees me. His hand is raised, a crust halfway to his open mouth.

PANEL 6

CAP
He stands and we look at each other for a long time.

Isabel, last night...

ISABEL
Yes.

Ah.

RICHARD
Should we be taking cover?

CUSTOMER
Aurelio and Jacinto. They've been arguing since 1898. Best of friends.

PANEL 4

RICHARD
What about?

CUSTOMER
The usual... Politics. Aurelio is of the right... Jacinto, a communist of the left..

PANEL 5

RICHARD
Don't they get tired of it? I mean, after all this time.

CUSTOMER
Oh no. They enjoy it. Mostly I think they do it to avoid their wives.

RICHARD
That bad?

CUSTOMER
A trial.

PANEL 6

EDWARD and RICHARD sit at a table in the bar. They are playing backgammon and drinking wine. The bar is full. In the background AURELIO and JACINTO are still going at it.

I heard we're being sent to Asturias.

That would be the third rumour this week. Asturias is a new twist though. ¡bravo!

PANEL 5

EDWARD
My lice are back from holiday. They seem well rested. They must have enjoyed your company.

RICHARD
Indeed. Some liked it so much they decided to stay for good.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 2013. DAY. GRANDMOTHERS VINYARD. SAUL and ISABEL stand between a long row of vines. They are in a field of vines - long symetrical parallel rows.

To live. To learn and see something of the world.

No. But this view has been painted. A long time ago.

PANEL 4

EXTERIOR: 2013. DAY. VILLAGE STREETS.

SAUL
Who painted the view?

ISABEL
Someone my Grandmother knew.

SAUL
But that can't be right. It must have been 250 years ago.

PANEL 5

ISABEL is looking at SAUL intently as they continue walking along the street. She is upset but is controlling it quietly.

PANEL 6

ISABEL lays a hand on his arm as they walk. She is gentle.

ISABEL
Now, how would you know that?

Don't kill me. My children, my wife. Don't kill me."

PANEL 2

EDWARD sits smiling watching the other men swim. ANBESSA is waving to him. The other men are swimming. Near one of the men is the same light that followed SAUL when he swam... The light is only a small presence in the panel and should not be too obvious.

ANBESSA
The moon blesses us! Come in. Wash your sins away.

PANEL 3

EDWARD walks naked into the lake.

PANEL 4

EXTERIOR: 1936. NIGHT. ON THE LAKE. DEEP IN THE FOREST. EDWARD swims. The naked woman, La Donna d' la Agua, swims with him. She is scowling. The other men do not see her and are splashing around or swimming.

PANEL 5

EXTERIOR: 1936. NIGHT. BY THE SIDE OF A LAKE. DEEP IN THE FOREST. EDWARD is at the bank, half in and half out of the water. He is in great pain and the water is 'boiling' around him. Its colour is the same colour as the water trail left by the Lady of the Lake. The other men stare, shocked. Now they see the light and the boiling water.

EDWARD
The water! The pain! Help me!

PANEL 6

EDWARD sits a few feet from the waters edge. The water is calm now. He stares at his legs. There are no wounds - no burns. The other men stand a few feet from him... Looking at him intently - unsettled.
EDWARD
But... It hurt so much!

Well you look alright now...

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. NIGHT. DEEP IN THE FOREST. A side view of the truck traveling along the dirt forest road. The road slopes sharply from the left of the panel to the right. Dust and stones spike up from the wheels. They are going too fast.

PANEL 2

A front view of the truck drivers cab. The driver has wide open eyes and a look of surprise and horror on his face. He is going to crash, and knows it is about to happen. His hands are on the wheel and his arms are straight, pushing him into a rigid position against the back of his seat.

PANEL 3

The truck strikes the tree that has fallen across the road. It pivots upwards from its rear and everyone in the back is thrown up into the air. The driver is half thrown through the windscreen.

PANEL 4

A view of tree trunks. They are horizontal. In the foreground, EDWARD lays on his side on the ground. He is vertical. His eyes are open. A trickle of blood flows across his forehead.

PANEL 5

RICHARD
Edward? Edward? Are you hurt? Can you move?

EDWARD
My God. What happened? The truck...

PANEL 6

RICHARD
They're dead.

EDWARD
What? Who?

The guards. Dead. They're all dead.

CHRISTOPHER
Dad. Why are you crying?

PANEL 2

SAUL looks in the hall mirror. Has his hand to his eye. We can see sons face in the mirror as well, behind SAUL. He looks worried. He has never seen his Father like this.

SAUL
I didn't know. Its alright, a touch of hay fever.

PANEL 3

We see SAULS hand. His tears are on his fingertips.

PANEL 4

EXTERIOR: 2006. NIGHT. BBQ PARTY. SAUL &amp; KATES FRIENDS HOUSE.

CAP
Amid the clouds of friends and cooking smoke, I resent being parted from her side. A scab must be picked at.

PANEL 5

CAP
As a cuckold I have dwindled, become clumsier and more brutal in my prejudices. My politics, crueller... "Sacrifices must be made", "Charity begins at home.", "We, after all, cannot help everyone".

CAP
I am unmanned and spiteful. I hate her and desire her. Salt in this open sore.

PANEL 6

INTERIOR: 2006. NIGHT. SAUL &amp; KATES BEDROOM.

CAP
Kate sleeps beside me, narrower, older somehow. Brimming with deceit and perfidy, poison held in the droplets of her breath.

PANEL 7

CAP
This sick terror, beating upon me like a rooks wings. The ghosts in this house only we can feel. She is leaving me. Even as she slumbers.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1762. NIGHT. RIVER DOCKS   VALLADOLID. FRANCISCO, aged 16, and a girl his own age, lay in the bottom of a row boat. The boat is tied to a series of other boats and the end boat is tied to the deserted quay. They are naked and entwined. They have obviously just had sex. They are covered in sweat and their hair is disarranged. They are very happy and content.

PANEL 2

FRANCISCO and the girl are dressing. FRANCISCO stands up in the row boat. He is standing on one leg, trying to pull his boot on. The boat is rocking. They are both laughing.

PANEL 3

Look at links: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HolyWeekprocession and the 'Easter' section of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valladolid

FRANCISCO runs full tilt across the front of the Easter parade. He is laughing uncontrollably. Some of the crowd are shouting disapprovingly. Others are laughing out loud.

PANEL 4

ALODIA and GABRIEL are standing in their hall. MARTA is in the background.

ALODIA
Late! You are late! Again!

PANEL 5

ALODIA, FRANCISCO, MARTA and GABRIEL are all standing in the hall. ALODIA is incandescent. FRANCISCO is smothering his laughter. GABRIEL is torn between the two, but stands behind ALODIA because he is trying to hide his indulgence of the boy.

ALODIA
Out drinking! And whoring, by the smell of you! Get to work! Straight away!

PANEL 6

Only ALODIA and GABRIEL remain in the hall. ALODIA is stabbing at GABRIELS chest with an accusing finger. GABRIEL has dissolved into laughter and she is halfway there herself.

ALODIA
It is not funny! Why you don't beat that boy, I don't know!

EXTERIOR: NIGHT. 1936. VILLAGE MARKET SQUARE. OUTSIDE BAR.
EDWARD and the rest of the men are sitting amongst the tables outside a bar. The MAYOR is with them. They are laughing. The MAYOR is leaning in towards EDWARD and the SERGEANT. A waitress is placing wine on the table. All of the men, other than EDWARD, the MAYOR and the SERGEANT, are laughing.
Panel 2
The panel should centre on the three men. EDWARD is smiling a little slyly.
MAYOR
Forgive me, but I must ask you a question.
Panel 3
The MAYOR looks apologetic but only on the surface. He is cleverer thatn he appears on the surface... EDWARD is still smiling.
EDWARD
Why are we here?
Panel 4
MAYOR
In this town there are two bars-
SERGEANT
Yes.
MAYOR
-one is for the peasants and one is for the hidalgos.
Panel 5

Where do you like to drink, gentlemen?
Panel 6
SERGEANT
At both-
EDWARD
-or none. Whatever is your choice. We are only here for rest and provisions.
MAYOR
I wonder. The witch thinks otherwise I think.

PANEL 1

INTERIOR: 2013. DAY. BARCELONA AIRPORT. ARRIVALS LOUNGE. Philip and Isabel are standing at the baggage carousel. Isabel is lifting a large backpack from the conveyor belt.

SAUL
When I said I would come to Spain to meet your Grandmother, two weeks hiking to get there wasn't really what I had in mind.

ISABEL
This is how I always go home. It is...

SAUL
Traditional?

PANEL 2

INTERIOR: 2013. DAY. BACK SEAT. MOVING TAXI.

SAUL
Isabel. I've not hiked since I was a boy. I'm not going to be very good at this.

ISABEL
Yo te protegeré.

PANEL 3

SAUL
I'm sorry. What did you say?

ISABEL
That I will protect you.

PANEL 4

EXTERIOR: 2013. DAY. BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. Isabel and Saul are standing by the side of the road. They are wearing their packs. The taxi is driving off into the distance.

ISABEL
Are you ready?

SAUL
No. Not really...

PANEL 5

From behind we see Isabel and Saul walking along a thin path into a forest. The forest rises in front of us until the treeline breaks and a series of mountain peaks are visible... snow topped and severe. Although it is sunny and hot, the forest looks uninviting and unsettling. The two hikers look small and insignificant.

SAUL and the GM sit in her kitchen drinking coffee. They discuss the diary. SAUL asks her how she knew where he lived. She avoids the question. SAUL comments that the diary only covers the point up to the point where EDWARD and the other men reach the village but no further. It seems unfinished even though the last page is filled.She avoids the implied question. "Good talking to you. Thanks for the information"</Text>

SAUL wakes in his room at the GM's. He rises and looks out of the window over the sunlit farm. Sees the orchard next to the church. Notices the black tree among the normal trees. He walks down the landing to take a shower, and notices through the open door, the dark painting hanging in the GM's room. He is startled and turns to see the GM looking at him. She looks at him for a moment. "If you hurt her..."

A single coin... But you yourself cannot cross.

It is the same as the lion carved into the tree trunk by Anbessa.

EXTERIOR: 1760. DAY. PLAZA. CHURCH OF SAN PABLO. VALLADOLID. GABRIEL and FRANCISCO stand side by side. FRANCISCO is looking at the façade of the Dominican Church of San Pablo. GABRIEL is looking at FRANCISCO.

GABRIEL
History, and God, show us how we reached this point, today - this very moment.

GABRIEL
Our successes and our sins are shaped by what comes before. Yes? You understand?

GABRIEL
Not yet... No matter. You will. I will teach you.

PANEL 3

INTERIOR: 1760. DAY. CHURCH OF SANTIAGO. VALLADOLID. GABRIEL and FRANCISCO stand side by side in front of a rerodos, (a screen or decoration behind the altar in a church), depicting the adoration of the magi.

FRANCISCO
I see.

PANEL 1

INTERIOR: 1997. SAULS LOUNGE.

CAP
Mr Kramer loves Mrs Kramer. My eyes never leave her. It makes us nervous and skittish.

PANEL 2

CAP
I follow her around our home, stumbling foot to foot with love. She is porcelain to me. Impossible not to touch.

PANEL 3

CAP
And I cannot touch her enough. Often to her annoyance. The sight of her at the sink draws my hands to her breasts, her thighs. An abrasive act of worship.

PANEL 4

CAP
I want to swim through her love the way my children do, effortless and ripe.

PANEL 5

CAP
And so I call her, many times a day, just to hear her voice. Each call is a weight upon her. My desire, a paranoia, forces the breath from her.

PANEL 6

CAP
My surfeit of love. A gluttony. A sin.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 2013. DAY. DESTROYED MOUNTAIN-TOP ABBEY DEEP IN THE FOREST. SAUL and ISABEL are looking around. ISABEL is looking a little sad. The walls of the abbey are semi-flattened and look like the ruins of an ancient Roman site.

PANEL 2

SAUL
What was this place?

ISABEL
A kind of library. My Grandmother told me that many learned men lived here... Philosophers, poets and artists. Years ago. Before the war.

PANEL 3

SAUL is waving a finger at the ruins. He looks a little dumbfounded.

SAUL
This... in the war?

ISABEL
Yes. A great sin.

PANEL 4

SAUL is walking around the ruin, looking at the damage. His hand is reaching out unconsciously to the stone walls as he walks. His fingertips are gently brushing the stone walls.

SAUL
It looks older...ancient, really.

SAUL
Who would destroy a library?

SAUL
Are we beasts?

PANEL 5

ISABEL is unpacking her backpack. SAUL is looking at the sky. The sun is high and very bright. It is a beautiful day.

ISABEL
Help me with the tent. The wind is getting up and it will rain soon.

SAUL
I don't think so.

PANEL 6

A view over the ruins at what looks like late dusk - but is in fact an hour later than the previous panel. We see the destroyed abbey, and a wide view of the forested valley below the treeline. In the middle of the abbey ruins is a two man tent. It should look small in the panel - the effect should be to show how small they are against the night. ISABEL and SAUL are inside it. We see their silhouettes as they have a light inside the tent. They are sitting. Around them a storm rages. The clouds are dark. The rain comes down heavily and is blown around by a strong wind.

SAUL
OK, so I may have been wrong.

PANEL 3

ISABEL and SAUL still walking in the forest. ISABEL is still ten paces ahead. They are still not speaking.

PANEL 4

SAUL reaches out and takes ISABEL's hand in his own. She is turned away from him but she is looking back at him over her shoulder.

SAUL
I'm sorry. Jesus, Isabel. You were right. I'm sorry. I drink... too much... And too often.

ISABEL
Give it to me. All of it!

PANEL 5

ISABEL
Is this everything? ¿Todo?

SAUL
Yes. All of it.

PANEL 6

ISABEL pours the contents of the two bottles onto the ground... One in each hand. SAUL looks on embarrassed, trying to conceal his addicts surliness at watching the drink wasted.

ISABEL
Now empty your backpack.

RICHARD
Bloody row. Is just one language too much to ask for?

PANEL 3

RICHARD
Erm... Did you square things with Clara before you left?

EDWARD
I lied. I said I was still writing for the Newspaper.

PANEL 4

RICHARD
So she doesn't know you're here to fight?

EDWARD
No. I feel terrible. And I think she wanted to tell me something, but she wouldn't. She cried.

PANEL 5

RICHARD
Edward, you really should write and tell her you know. Before we cross the border.

EDWARD
I know. I will. I love her very much. But Richard, despite everything, I want to go to war.

PANEL 3

ISABEL
Tu

SAUL
What?

ISABEL
Mi is my, tu is your. And yes, she did.

PANEL 4

Isabel marches off ahead. Very business-like. She enjoys the open air and is in her natural element here in the forest. She is at home. Saul watches her attractive backside.

PANEL 5

We see them both walking along a path between the trees. Isabel is seven or eight paces ahead. Saul is trudging. He is not enjoying himself.

PANEL 6

SAUL
Do we camp soon?

ISABEL

CAP
The mountainside smells of sun and pine needles. The leather of my gunstrap and the good earth.

There is no joy in it. Let the man go home to his grandchildren.

The rooks.

CAP
They sit in the trees above us in their hundreds. They are silent. They look down upon us. Branch upon branch of black-winged watchers.

            <Text>COMIC SCRIPT FORMAT
Contributed by Antony Johnson

About This Template
When compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a script suitable for comics and graphic novels. There is no industry standard for comic scripting, so this template was created by comics writer Antony Johnston, based on his earlier Final Draft template:

http://antonyjohnston.com/resources/samplescripts.php

Antony has also written an article for his website, demonstrating how he uses Scrivener and this template:

http://antonyjohnston.com/resources/scriveningcomics.php

Antony’s original Final Draft template was designed in partnership with Andy Diggle, whose own template could equally serve as a basis for your own Scrivener comic script format:

http://andydiggle.blogspot.com/2006/07/final-draft-for-comics.html

Or, you could create an entirely new template that fits the way you work, using Format &gt; Script Settings… to completely customise the script template.

How To Use This Template

Title Page
	•	A document entitled “Title Page” can be found in the “Front Matter” folder. This is used to hold the title, by-line and your name and address. Be sure to change the information in this document as appropriate.

Story Pages
	•	Pages are represented by text documents in the “Draft 1” folder. Upon compile for export or print, a page break is inserted between them.
	⁃	Note that the “Draft 1” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. A number has been appended for use in headers during Compile - see below.
	•	Each “Page” can contain numerous panels, followed by the description text and dialogue for that panel.
	•	To create new pages, one way is to go to the Projects menu and select New From Template &gt; Comic Page. The new, blank page will appear immediately below the current Binder selection. You can also click and hold the green “Add” toolbar button to select the “Comic Page” document type, or hit Shift-Opt-Cmd-N on the keyboard. However, the easiest way is to click “Add” or hit Cmd-N - while the focus is in the “Comic Script” folder, new documents created will automatically be based on the “Comic Page” template (which can be found in the “Templates” folder). This is because the “Comic Script” folder is set to use the “Comic Page” template as its default document type (this has been set via Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments).

Compiling
To compile, go to File &gt; Compile and ensure that “Comic Script” is selected in the list of formats on the left.

Page Headers
	•	Page headers use the settings in the Metadata pane of Compile, which can be accessed by clicking the tag icon above the contents list on the right of the Compile panel. Be sure to set the title of the project and writer name there.
	•	Page headers also display a draft number. This is taken from the title of the Draft folder. In a new project, this is “Draft 1”. Be sure to change the title of the Draft folder if you wish to increment the draft number.

About the Styles Used
	•	This template contains the most common styles used for comics: Page Number, Panel Number, Panel Description, Character, Dialogue and Parenthetical.
	•	Page Number appears only once for each page, at the top of the document. Pressing TAB after typing will insert the &lt;$N&gt; character string, which will be replaced with sequential numbering upon compile and so allows you to auto-number your pages.
	•	Panel Number is used to denote a single panel of comic art on the page. Press TAB after typing to insert the &lt;$sn&gt; string, which will auto-number your panels within each page during the Compile process. Press ENTER to automatically put the text into Panel Description mode.
	•	Panel Description is used to describe the image within each panel of art. Multiple paragraphs of Panel Description text can be used in a panel description. Therefore, press ENTER after typing to keep the text in Panel Description mode. To enter Character mode, press TAB either after typing, or while on a blank line.
	•	Character denotes a speaking character within a panel, and precedes their dialogue. Press ENTER to put the text into Dialogue mode. Press TAB to make notes on lettering style for the dialogue that follows, e.g. “Large”, “Small”, “Jagged”, or “Off” (useful for when a speaking character is not visible in panel). These notes are usually made in parentheses, so in this template a left parenthesis (i.e. the “(” character) is automatically inserted after the character’s name, and the auto-complete library for this style contains text with closed parentheses. 
	•	Caption boxes are regarded as dialogue, and so “CAPTION” should be used in place of a character name, followed by the text to appear in the box.
	•	Sound effects are similarly denoted with “SFX”.
	•	If a panel is completely silent (i.e. has no dialogue, caption or sound effect) then a character of “NO DIALOGUE” should be entered, ending the panel.
	•	Dialogue is the speech of each character. Dialogue is not broken up into true paragraphs. Therefore, press ENTER to move the text back into Panel Description mode. If you wish to break a long section of dialogue into multiple balloons, press TAB to enter Parenthetical mode.
	•	Parenthetical is used to link together multiple dialogue balloons spoken by the same character in a single panel. Simply type “cont” and hit either TAB or ENTER; parentheses will automatically be placed around the “cont” text, and the text will return to Dialogue mode on a new line.
	•	Other lettering notes can also be made in the parentheticals after the “cont” text, e.g. “cont, small” or “cont, jagged”. Lettering notes that affect the entire dialogue should be made on the Character line, as noted above.

Sample Document
See the “Comic Script” PDF file in the Research folder for an example of a document that has been created using this template, and to see a short sample of how a comic script using Antony’s format should look.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to comic script writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.

Thank you to Antony Johnston for contributing this template.</Text>

PANEL 1

INTERIOR: DAY. 2013. KATES KITCHEN. KATE stands at the end of the kitchen worktop. Between her and SAUL is the kitchen table. KATE looks nervous and belligerent at the same time. Her arms are folded and she leans back against the sink. We see her over SAULS shoulder. A dull bruise still shows on her right cheek.

PANEL 2

SAUL
Look, Kate-

KATE
Shut up! Just don't say anything! Don't say anything.

PANEL 3

KATE is looking at SAUL. SAUL is looking down at the ground. He is ashamed but at the same time knows that she is playing a role - her fear an emotional tool. He cannot fight it.

PANEL 4

SAUL
OK. I understand.

KATE
I don't care what you understand, you bastard. I want a divorce.

PANEL 5

INTERIOR: DAY. 2013. KATES HALL. SAUL is opening the front door. KATE is standing at the end of the hall.

KATE
Do you hear me? Hey!

PANEL 6

EXTERIOR: DAY. 2013. KATES FRONT GARDEN. SAUL is walking along the front garden path. He is facing us. He looks stricken and defeated. We see KATE over his shoulder. Her resentment and simulated fear has bubbled up into her face.

KATE 
Do you hear me? I want that divorce!

SAUL questions ISABEL re the accident and their actions in preparing and carrying out the 'healing'. ISABEL is a little evasive but admits that her GM (and she) is the village healer and that this has an element of witchcraft to it. The women in her family have a long tradition in this and it is passed from generation to generation. SAUL asks her if she, as a modern medical student, really believes it. She says that reality nd myth are close here. She shrugs and says that the evidence is all around them in these mountains. "Have you not seen?" SAUL says "Like in the painting?" ISABEL looks at him curiously and says "... The painting? Grandmothers painting?" </Text>

SAUL sits on a park bench. He is looking at his feet.

Its hot. The night is now completely black lit only by the lightning. SAUL should have his head in his hands, with the book open in front of him. He should look up at ISABEL with wide eyes. Try to invoke increasing tension. His fingers should be rigid and clawlike on the kitchen table.</Text>

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: NIGHT. 1936. VILLAGE MARKET SQUARE. OUTSIDE BAR. EDWARD and the rest of the men are sitting amongst the tables outside a bar. The MAYOR is with them. They are laughing. The MAYOR is leaning in towards EDWARD and the SERGEANT. A waitress is placing wine on the table. All of the men, other than EDWARD, the MAYOR and the SERGEANT, are laughing.

PANEL 2

The panel should centre on the three men. EDWARD is smiling a little slyly.

MAYOR
Forgive me, but I must ask you a question.

PANEL 3

The MAYOR looks apologetic but only on the surface. He is cleverer thatn he appears on the surface... EDWARD is still smiling.

EDWARD
Why are we here?

PANEL 4

MAYOR
In this town there are two bars-

SERGEANT
Yes.

MAYOR
-one is for the peasants and one is for the hidalgos.

PANEL 5

MAYOR (CONT'D)
Where do you like to drink, gentlemen?

PANEL 6

SERGEANT
At both-

EDWARD
-or none. Whatever is your choice. We are only here for rest and provisions.

MAYOR
I wonder. The witch thinks otherwise I think.

SAUL wakes in his room at the GM's. He rises and looks out of the window over the sunlit farm. Sees the orchard next to the church. Notices the black tree among the normal trees. He walks down the landing to take a shower, and notices through the open door, the dark painting hanging in the GM's room. He is startled and turns to see the GM looking at him. She looks at him for a moment. "If you hurt her..."

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 2013. NIGHT. DEEP IN THE FOREST. SAUL is walking through the forest. There is no light but moonlight.

PANEL 2

We see a pool of light. It should be small amongst the trees. A naked figure sits within it. It looks like ISABEL.

PANEL 3

ISABEL squats naked. She is urinating on the ground. Her hair is up, one lock used to wrap the others. SAUL stands transfixed.

PANEL 4

ISABEL stands. In the lamplight she is beautiful... Botticelli's Venus. SAUL can be seen in the background. She is looking in the opposite direction to him.

PANEL 5

SAUL walks back through the trees. His hand rests on the trunk of a tree. Next to his hand is a carving of a lion.

PANEL 6

We see ISABEL, still naked... She is smiling serenely - someone with a secret.

ISABEL
Padre Celestial y Madre de la luna. Él es como un niño. Ayúdame con él.

Injured man arrives and is cared for. Partly by straight medicine. The taking of 'medicine' and addition of poltices etc. Then the two women are visited by another older woman. Older than GM.The three women then carry out a ceremony of some sort. The room becomes full of 'shades' / 'presences'. Darkness and light. Research this. It should still feel domestic though. The things used in the ceremony should be kitchen utensils etc. It should take a night and a day. The passage of time should be shown somehow. At the end of it it should be apparent that the man is weak but will live. SAUL should sleep through some of it. </Text>

SAUL
Isabel, I don't... I don't understand what happened today.

PANEL 2

ISABEL
The forest is old. The trees have their roots in another time... Another way.

SAUL
I don't know what that means. And the wolf?

PANEL 3

ISABEL
You are unhappy. The wolf, the others, want to be near you. To enjoy you.

PANEL 4

SAUL
No. No. Still no clearer.

ISABEL
Don't worry. I am your guide.

SAUL climbs into the orchard. He sees everything but cannot prevent anything. He reads as he walks. He sees EDWARD about to kill RICHARD and cries out to try to stop it, but cannot be heard.

PANEL 1


EXTERIOR: 2002. DAY. GRAVEYARD. All the graves are in poor condition - weed choked, and stripped of their marble. Some are broken.

CAP
It is strange how once graves are abandoned, the people in them are truly dead.

PANEL 2

Kate is walking among the graves.

PANEL 3

Kate stands in front of a gravestone. She reads the inscription, which is of a child - a girl. The inscription should read "Rebecca Caplin. Our little angel. Born 13/06/1903 Died 24/12/1906."

PANEL 4

INTERIOR: 2002. DAY. HOSPITAL ROOM. Kate lays in a hospital bed. She is unhappy, staring vacantly.

PANEL 5

INTERIOR: 2002. NIGHT. SAUL &amp; KATES BEDROOM. KATE lays on her side in the bed. She faces the reader. SAUL sits behind her. His hand is on her shoulder.

CAP
I was away working when she miscarried. A girl.

PANEL 6

INTERIOR: 2002. DAY. SAUL &amp; KATES GARDEN. KATE sits on a garden bench. She has a book open on her knee but is staring off to her left. SAUL is in the background. He is mowing the lawn.

CAP
Over the next few days we lied to each other.
CAP
I told her I understood. Kate said she believed me.
CAP
After that we didn't speak of our daughter again.

PANEL 1

INTERIOR: 2006. NIGHT. SAUL &amp; KATES LIVING ROOM. SAUL is sitting on the sofa. His hand is outstretched and his palm is open. The book is in mid-air where he has gently tossed it. Open pages can be seen splayed out.

CAP
12:30am

CAP
I try to read. But the adventures of Ishmael and Queequag do not hold me.

PANEL 2

INTERIOR: 2006. NIGHT. SAUL &amp; KATES KITCHEN. SAUL is standing by the toaster. He is buttering toast. A glass of orange juice sits by his side on the worktop.

CAP
02:05am

CAP
I eat for the sake of it. To waste a moment or two. To kill time. To avoid thinking.

PANEL 3

EXTERIOR: 2006. NIGHT. SAUL &amp; KATES BACK GARDEN. SAUL is standing in the middle of the lawn. The light from the living room window lights him from behind. He holds the glass in his left hand and is looking at it.

CAP
03:45am

CAP
I would like to break this glass. To crush it into tiny shards, to its compact and ancient materials.

CAP
But I do not have the courage now. I am a half man. A small man, inside.

PANEL 4

INTERIOR: 2006. NIGHT. SAUL &amp; KATES SONS BEDROOM. SAUL is standing in the dorway of his sons bedroom. The door is only half open. We see SAUL over his sons shoulder. The son is laying in bed and is facing the reader. There is the usual stuff of a teenage boy in the room - clothes thrown around, posters, books, computer etc.

CAP
04:30am

CAP
I know that I am going to lose this child and his sleeping brothers.

CAP
That I will have to acknowledge what I already know.

PANEL 5

INTERIOR: 2006. NIGHT. SAUL &amp; KATES LIVING ROOM. SAUL sits on the sofa. His hands are by his side. He looks numb. He stares straight at the reader.

CAP
06:15am

CAP
I hear our front door open and close. I feel sick. I want to go to her, to hold her.

CAP
My desires are shrivelled and dry as dust. I am a coward.

PANEL 6

INTERIOR: 2006. NIGHT. SAUL &amp; KATES LIVING ROOM. A side view of SAUL. SAUL sits on the sofa. His hands are by his side. He looks numb.

CAP
06:25am

PANEL 1

INTERIOR: 2005. NIGHT. HOTEL BAR. CONFERENCE. OSLO. SAUL is sitting in at semi-circular booth table with four other people. He looks like a man suffering but too polite to show it. A sign on the wall should read 'Radison Hotel Oslo'. There are many drinks - full and empty on the table.

PANEL 2

Everyone at the table is listening to a drunken delegate who is in the middle of telling a story.

CAP
I first met 'Professor Arsehole' - dont know his actual name - at last years Klee conference in Paris. He told the same boring story then too.

PROFESSOR ARSEHOLE
...and so I told him that if it was good enough for Pollock it was good enough for me!

PANEL 3

Everyone at the table is laughing. SAUL is rising from his seat. He is not laughing.

SAUL
I'm going to the bar.

PANEL 4

Saul is standing at the bar. The barman is in the background preparing drinks. A woman is standing next to SAUL. We cannot see her face.

PROSTITUTE
Would you like to buy me a drink?

PANEL 5

INTERIOR: 2005. NIGHT. HOTEL LIFT. CONFERENCE. OSLO. SAUL and the PROSTITUTE are standing side by side in the hotel lift. They both face the reader. The walls of the lift are mirrored. Both people look neutral. A modern day 'American Gothic'.

PANEL 6

INTERIOR: 2005. DAY. HOTEL ROOM (BATHROOM). CONFERENCE. OSLO. SAUL is standing in front of his hotel room bathroom mirror. The room is brightly lit. He is shaving. The foam covers his face, and the razor in his right hand is cutting a single path through the foam on the left-hand side of his face.

CAP
In the morning she cleaned herself and left. I rang my wife and, as she woke, told her I loved her.

PART 2 - VISIT THE TWO BARS - USE IT AS A WAY TO SHOW THE TWO 'CAMPS' IN THE VILLAGE. DESCRIBE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE RICH - THE HILDALGOS.

PANEL 1

RICHARD AND EDWARD walk across the village square towards the 'poor' bar. Their conversational tone is light and a little jokey.

RICHARD (CONT'D)
I feel a little grubby after that conversation.

EDWARD
Shall we drink with the proletariat for a while?

RICHARD
We shall.

RICHARD (CONT'D)
An odd couple, don't you think?

EDWARD
I quite liked them. At least they were honest.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR. 2008.DAY. SUNNY AFTERNOON. PUBLIC PARK. Saul sits on a park bench. His arms are wide along the ridge of the seat back. He is smiling gently... watching a bunch of kids playing football... Day dreaming.

CAP
I feel a sense of release. A calm after the storm.

PANEL 2

CAP
A sense of freedom. I'm going to be better - a finer man. This is a new chance.

PANEL 3

The ball is kicked high in the air. We see a close up of it in the sunny sky.

CAP
I see new horizons. I'm going to be more focussed at work. Get promoted.

PANEL 4

The ball bounces and rolls to SAULS feet as he sits. He smiles.

CAP
I should get fit. Play some sport. Lose some weight...

PANEL 5

SAUL is standing. He is kicking the ball back to the boys.

CAP
... (if I ever want to have sex again).

PANEL 6

The foreground of the panel is two kids talking to each other. They are laughing. SAUL can be seen in the background walking off towards the park entry gates.

KID 1
Who's the old bloke?

KID 2
Dunno... Some paedo.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. NIGHT. CAMPSITE. ABOVE THE TREELINE. MOUNTAINS EDWARD is sat on a rock. He is on sentry duty. The night is moonlit.

CAP
The Sergeant says no fire so we are cold. We should have reached home two days ago and we have no food.

PANEL 2

CAP
Others are worried but I am calm. I am happier here, in these mountains and with these men, than I have ever been.

PANEL 3

CAP
There is a purity to it. A simplicity of motive. Action and consequence more closely linked than before.

PANEL 4

CAP
During the night I am visited by each of the men I have killed. I explain this purity to them. I engage them in reasoned debate...

PANEL 5

CAP
...and they understand. Their acceptance a vindication. A denial of my decay.

PANEL 6

EXTERIOR: 1936. SUNRISE. CAMPSITE. ABOVE THE TREELINE. MOUNTAINS.

CAP
I am comforted by their empathy, their closeness, and their leaving.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR. 1936. DAY. PLAZA. VILLAGE. The men stand in the centre of the plaza. There are no signs of life from the village at all. The buildings look in poor condition and have not been maintained. They do not, however, look derelict. Just uncared for.

MATEO
Where is everyone?

PANEL 2

SERAFIN is looking at the bar on the edge of the plaza.

SERAFIN
I could do with a drink.

SERGEANT
And food. Come on.

SERAFIN
Thank God.

EDWARD
I want to find someone first. Richard?

PANEL 3

EXTERIOR. 1936. DAY. STREET. VILLAGE. We see RICHARD and EDWARD, from the rear, walking along a narrow street. There are houses on both sides of the street. The street slopes downwards steeply. Any streets visible should slope downwards.

PANEL 4

EXTERIOR. 1936. DAY. RIVERBANK. VILLAGE. EDWARD and RICHARD stand at the end of the street. Our view is over the shoulders. We see the, (200 or so), village inhabitants. They are by, and in, the river that flows through the village at its lowest point.
Half the villagers are on the banks of the river. They are in a state of turmoil. Half, (the prodigal), are feverishly throwing food, drink and money into the air. The other half, (the avaricious), are scrabbling at their feet, grasping the things thrown by the prodigal. They paw at the prodigal for more. No-one is happy - there should be a desperate, hysterical, air to it. The prodigal and the avaricious should look like they are arguing with each other.
The remainder of the villagers are in the river. They are fighting - punching and biting each other. At the edges of the river, in the mud and froth churned up by the fighting, lay exhausted villagers - indolent and uncaring.
Overall, the panel should be bigger than the others - perhaps the width of the page. It should have a Heronymous Bosch feel to it. A stone bridge, in the middle of the panel, should cross the narrow river.

PANEL 5

EXTERIOR. 1936. DAY. BRIDGE. RIVER. VILLAGE. EDWARD and RICHARD stand on the bridge over the river. EDWARD leans on the parapet of the bridge with his arms crossed. He looks quietly amused. RICHARD stands a little back from the edge of the bridge. He looks shocked and uncomfortable, as if he does not want to get too close to the madness of the villagers below.

RICHARD
This is horrible. What is going on?

EDWARD
No idea. But my money is on the big bloke in the red shirt. Hell of a right hand.

PANEL 6

RICHARD looks a little frightened of EDWARD.

EXTERIOR: 1760. DAY. BALCONY. REAR GARDEN. ATILIOS HOUSE. VALLADOLID. GABRIEL and FRANCISCO are standing on the balcony. GABRIEL is hanging a small mirror on a nail on the balcony frame. There is a table and three chairs on the balcony. Underneath the mirror is a small round topped table holding a bowl of water, a shaving brush, a cake of soap and a cut-throat razor.

GABRIEL
Sit.

PANEL 2

GABRIEL uses a shaving brush to apply soap to his face. The frame should show him applying soap with his right-hand to the left underside of his chin.

GABRIEL
So, boy, you want to paint?

FRANCISCO
I do, sir.

PANEL 3

CAP
The Master sets the blade at an angle and began. The razor rasps on the hard hairs of his throat.

CAP
Whenever the foam on the blade grew too large, he wiped it carefully with a piece of cloth.

PANEL 4

GABRIEL
Look around. What do you see?

PANEL 5

Close up of the sunlit foam on the blade of the razor held in GABRIELS hand.

FRANCISCO
I see Mother of Pearl. On your blade.

PANEL 6

GABRIEL holds the razor up to the sun. He is completely focused on the foam. He should look quietly satisfied with FRANCISCOS response.

You. You allow your skirt... this black skirt to slide off your raised knee, and along your thighs, so that their undersides are exposed.

You arch your toes, to release the heel of your shoe. The ashy white of your thighs inner side is lazily laid bare.

EXTERIOR: DAY. 1936. VILLAGE MARKET SQUARE.
GRANDMOTHER and the men emerge from a side street into the busy village square. They are seen from the other side of the square. EDWARD is looking at GRANDMOTHER. GRANDMOTHER is smiling knowingly as she looks around her. She is waving at a fat priest. He looks a little uncomfortable. A young woman is walking away from him, looking agitated, looking over her shoulder at GRANDMOTHER.
Panel 2
GRANDMOTHER leans close to RICHARD. She has a hand on RICHARDS shoulder. She is smiling conidentially.
GRANDMOTHER
(Whispers)... He really hates me...
RICHARD
(whispers)... You? Why?
Panel 3
The priest is walking away. He is looking over his shoulder at GRANDMOTHER. GRANDMOTHER is raising her voice. She is pointedly speaking loudly, distinctly, in a singsong manner, to make sure the priest can hear.
GRANDMOTHER
Oh, a little lust! A little spice! Quite a lot of something nice!
Panel 4
A tall thin sombre looking man is looking down at GRANDMOTHER in a kindly, but slightly disapproving way. She is smiling.
MAYOR
Now now, my dear. Leave the poor man alone.
GRANDMOTHER
Oh Roberto! Where's your sense of humour?
Panel 5
GRANDMOTHER
This is our Mayor. Senor Roberto.
MAYOR
Good afternoon Gentlemen. You look well armed. Should I be worried? Perhaps taking to the hills?
Panel 6
GRANDMOTHER takes Edward by the hand and is pulling him away. The MAYOR is looking towards her. He is frowning slightly. He realises something is amiss.
GRANDMOTHER
Come. Let's find you all a bed. Then food and wine. And a bath. I smelt you before I saw you.

Meet our new friend, Father Ramon. He is not a good Catholic.

I am a splendid Catholic. The Church is not a good Catholic however.

MATEO
Good luck telling them that.

PANEL 4

SERGEANT
The good Father has very kindly been describing the struggle between a good, spiritual world of light, and an evil, material world of darkness.

FATHER RAMON
Yes. Through an ongoing process which takes place in human history, light is gradually removed from the world of matter and returned to the world of light from which it came.

PANEL 5

RICHARD
So you're saying we - as matter - will end in darkness?

FATHER RAMON
Yes. I'm afraid so.

Very funny.

GM confronts SAUL in the kitchen. "The only reason you came here is for the painting. It is avarice and ambition. SAUL blurts out enthusiasm for the painting. Its qualities. Its value. As he speaks his face should show the same deformity as the bandits in EDWARDS story. GM says "You are not resolved, not redeemed. You are as sick as when you began." SAUL notices ISABEL in the doorway. She is looking at him in a horrified way SAUL starts to go to her. GM says "Stay there!". GM slams down another diary on the kitchen table in front of him. GM - The final part of you Grandfathers diary... "Read!"  </Text>

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: DAY. 1936. VILLAGE MARKET SQUARE. GRANDMOTHER and the men emerge from a side street into the busy village square. They are seen from the other side of the square. EDWARD is looking at GRANDMOTHER. GRANDMOTHER is smiling knowingly as she looks around her. She is waving at a fat priest. He looks a little uncomfortable. A young woman is walking away from him, looking agitated, looking over her shoulder at GRANDMOTHER.

PANEL 2

GRANDMOTHER leans close to RICHARD. She has a hand on RICHARDS shoulder. She is smiling conidentially.

GRANDMOTHER
(Whispers)... He really hates me...

RICHARD
(whispers)... You? Why?

PANEL 3

The priest is walking away. He is looking over his shoulder at GRANDMOTHER. GRANDMOTHER is raising her voice. She is pointedly speaking loudly, distinctly, in a singsong manner, to make sure the priest can hear.

GRANDMOTHER
Oh, a little lust! A little spice! Quite a lot of something nice!

PANEL 4

A tall thin sombre looking man is looking down at GRANDMOTHER in a kindly, but slightly disapproving way. She is smiling.

MAYOR
Now now, my dear. Leave the poor man alone.

GRANDMOTHER
Oh Roberto! Where's your sense of humour?

PANEL 5

GRANDMOTHER
This is our Mayor. Senor Roberto.

MAYOR
Good afternoon Gentlemen. You look well armed. Should I be worried? Perhaps taking to the hills?

PANEL 6

GRANDMOTHER takes Edward by the hand and is pulling him away. The MAYOR is looking towards her. He is frowning slightly. He realises something is amiss.

GRANDMOTHER
Come. Let's find you all a bed. Then food and wine. And a bath. I smelt you before I saw you.

PANEL 2

GRANDMOTHER and EDWARD are talking as they walk. He likes the look of her. She is looking at him and smiling a little wryly.

EDWARD
So, are you married, Senorita?

GRANDMOTHER
No. Are you?

GRANDMOTHER
Ah, so you are. A dangerous man then. Dishonourable even?

EDWARD
Perhaps.

PANEL 3

GRANDMOTHER
You have children.

EDWARD
Possibly.

PANEL 4

GRANDMOTHER
Possibly?

EDWARD
I'm not sure. It may be.

GRANDMOTHER
It may indeed. A son, and in time a Grandson.

PANEL 5

EDWARD looks quietly amused.

EDWARD
Any ideas for a name?

GRANDMOTHER
I may have.

EDWARD
You should let me know. I'll mention it when I see him.

PANEL 6

GRANDMOTHER is looking at EDWARD very intently and a little sadly. EDWARD is looking at her in a puzzled fashion.

GRANDMOTHER
I don't see you ever doing that.

Strange to see you on this side unbidden. Bringing men back?

Very droll.

ISABEL is leaning right over the side of the boat and is stroking one of the creatures that surrounds the boat with her right hand. ISABEL is smiling.

FERRY WOMAN
She remembers you.

FERRY WOMAN
Your man looks a little green around the gills. Are you seasick hombre?

PANEL 4

EXTERIOR: 2013. NIGHT. ON THE RIVER. DEEP IN THE FOREST. We see SAUL huddled in the bottom of the boat. He is unwell and has fever sweats. His arms are cradling his stomach and he is in pain.

ISABEL
I'm sorry. I did not expect this so soon.

FERRY WOMAN
It is of no import.

PANEL 5

We see a side view of the two faces. They each fill one side of the panel. The FERRY WOMAN studies SAULS face from only a couple of inches away.

Stay. He is too sick for now. Use my house until he can travel.

GABRIEL
Look at her! Come Francisco, you must look at her. Look! Study! Perceive! You cannot paint what you will not see!

PANEL 2

A beautiful girl - around 19 years old - is laying on a chez longue. She is dressed only in a robe - held below her shoulders but exposing the tops of her arms and a lot of cleavage. She is posing in a mildly seductive and confident manner. She looks intelligent and a little mischevious.

PANEL 3

GABRIEL
You must pay particular attention to her skin. Look at the light play on her shoulders. Her neck. Look!

FRANCISCO
Yes Master.

PANEL 4

We see the girl again.

GABRIEL
(off panel)
Oh, pity poor St Benito! Thats enough, go... Go! Ask Marta to find a floor for you to sweep!

He's a good boy.

I'm sure he is. Handsome too.

GABRIEL has removed the robe from her shoulders and his hand is on her bare thigh. They are smiling. She is overtly mischevious now.

GABRIEL

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. BARCELONA. NIGHT. VERY BUSY STREET. A view from the first floor balcony of a hotel. Over the two mens shoulders we see a mixture of trams, cars and mule carts. Old women shopping at stalls on the crowded square, shouting to make themselves heard. Straggling groups of children running between the traffic. Lean cats and mangy dogs, beggars and itinerant vendors. And everywhere, makeshift uniforms... khaki and boiler suit blue.

CAP
Barcelona 1936. A city given over to the proletariat.

PANEL 2

EXTERIOR: NIGHT. BAR. EDWARD and RICHARD sit opposite each other at an outside table. There are three wine bottles on the table. Two are empty and the third is half full. They look happy and content. Perhaps a little overwhelmed by the sights around them. In the background, a protest march is happening. Militia march with red banners saying "Ni Campesinos con hambre". At the rear of the march young children dressed in militia uniforms march. Their banners read "Queremos escuelas laicos". The youngest is about six and sucks her thumb.

PANEL 3

INTERIOR: NIGHT. CABARET BAR. EDWARD and RICHARD sit laughing amongst many others on a bench. Theirs is one of many other parallel benches in this smoky room. At the end of the room is a stage. On it a group of women dancers perform. A band perform to one side. The men in the audience whistle through their fingers. Many stand and shout to their friends in other rows. It is cheerful bedlam.

RICHARD
They dance very... artistically. La revolución is quite the aphrodisiac.

PANEL 2

EXTERIOR: DAY TO NIGHT. 1936. VILLAGE STREET. The panel should stretch the width of the page. The men are seen in a single line - we see the right hand profile. The left of the panel should be daylight, and as the eye travels along the width of the panel, it should become night.

PANEL 3

EXTERIOR: DAY. 1936. VILLAGE STREET. The panel should stretch the width of the page. Our view is from a rooftop looking down into the street. We are looking down upon the men while the walk along the street. We are looking over the shoulders of the three eyeless, winged, women. One of the womens hands rests on a roof tile. Next to it we can see the shape of a line. It is the same as the lion carved into the tree trunk by Anbessa.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: DAY. 1936. A FOREST PATH. IN THE FOREST. The men are lying in the undergrowth to either side of the forest path. They are waiting to ambush the patrol following them.

RICHARD
"Midway upon the journey of our life I found myself within a forest dark, for the straight-forward pathway had been lost."

PANEL 2

EDWARD is laying near RICHARD and is smiling at him.

EDWARD
Not really a time for the classics Richard.

PANEL 3

We can see both RICHARD and EDWARD from behind. They are looking down the forest path. Nothing can be seen.

PANEL 4

We see the men laying side by side.

RICHARD
Richard. The thing that Clara was trying to tell you. You remember? Before we came here.

EDWARD
Yes.

PANEL 5

RICHARD is looking a little nervous. As if he does not know how to approach the subject.

RICHARD
She was pregnant. That was it wasn't it?

EDWARD
I believe so... now.

PANEL 6

RICHARD is looking at EDWARD. EDWARD is stony-faced, looking away. He has withdrawn within himself.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. MOUNTAIN PATH. ABOVE THE TREELINE. MOUNTAINS. The men are walking along a mountain path heading upwards. They look tired. There is a violent wind blowing against them and the sky is dark. They should be heavily bowed against the wind. It is not raining yet but they should look like they are in a storm.

PANEL 2

An old man is sitting on a large rock in front of them. He has his legs drawn up and has a rifle resting across them. He is a short fat man - barrel chested and wears a sheepskin jerkin. He has a large white moustache. He does not look frail in any way.

PANEL 3

TRISTÁN slaps his belly with both hands. He is smiling.

TRISTÁN
I am Tristán and I am a bandit. But I am not working today. Do you have anything to eat? I am emptier than a whores virtue.
PANEL 4

EDWARD and the others are surrounded by a number of other bandits. Without exception, they are all fat, strong men like TRISTÁN. Some are middle aged, some are young but all appear strong and are well armed.

TRISTÁN
Do not worry about my friends. They are only here to make sure I get home to my wife. She is truly the frightening one.

PANEL 5

TRISTÁN is smiling and beckons them with a finger.

TRISTÁN
It is nearly dinner time. It is not far and it will soon rain and then the wind will become strong.

PANEL 6

CALVINO is incredulous.

CALVINO
The wind is not strong now?
TRISTÁN
Hah. No, this is a mere breeze. There is always much wind here. Like a priest after his lunch.

SAUL

PANEL 4

EXTERIOR: NIGHT 2013. KATES FRONT GARDEN PATH. SAUL is walking hurriedly away from KATES door. He looks panicked. He is scared of what he has done. He is scared of himself. KATE can be seen in the background, holding her face and laying on the lit hall.

SAUL and KATE are standing face to face, close together. He is cupping her naked left breast gently in his hand. Her face is turned to one side, partially away from SAUL and the reader. Both their expressions should be neutral.

CAP
I know that she does not want me. That I will take her anyway.

CAP
And that she will let me. With brittle regret. A turning away.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. FOREST PATH. IN THE FOREST. EDWARD and MATEO are hidden in foliage. They are looking at a small clearing. In the clearing are four men. Scruffy, in a mixture of multiple uniforms and peasant clothes. They are armed - but their weapons are poor rifles and look old. The men look dirty and ill-organised. MATEO is looking at the men carefully. EDWARD is smiling at MATEO.

MATEO
For us, for them, or for themselves? I cannot myself tell.

EDWARD
I would say Republican or bandits. Equally disreputable. I'll stay. Tell the others.

PANEL 2

The SERGEANT and the rest of the 'platoon' are standing at the edge of the clearing. EDWARD is sitting casually on a fallen tree log with his shotgun across his knees. At his feet lays the four mens rifles. They sit in the middle of the clearing with their hands on their heads. They look nervous.

PANEL 3

EDWARD, RICHARD and the SERGEANT stand off to one side of the clearing.

EDWARD
They say they're Republican. Lost. I think deserters but they say not. Anything is possible I suppose.

SERGEANT
What do we do with them? What do you think?

PANEL 4

EDWARD
Apparently, they would like to come along with us.

SERGEANT
Hmm.

RICHARD
We could do with the numbers.

EDWARD
There is the patrol to deal with.

PANEL 5

SERGEANT
We'll take them along.

RICHARD
They're an evil looking lot though.

PANEL 6

The SERGEANT and the rest of the men are walking single file along the forest path. ANBESSA and EDWARD are bringing up the rear of the column. EDWARD is once again looking over his shoulder down the path.

SAUL questions ISABEL re the accident and their actions in preparing and carrying out the 'healing'. ISABEL is a little evasive but admits that her GM (and she) is the village healer and that this has an element of witchcraft to it. The women in her family have a long tradition in this and it is passed from generation to generation. SAUL asks her if she, as a modern medical student, really believes it. She says that reality nd myth are close here. She shrugs and says that the evidence is all around them in these mountains. "Have you not seen?" SAUL says "Like in the painting?" ISABEL looks at him curiously and says "... The painting? Grandmothers painting?" </Text>

What?

PANEL 2

We see the front of the GRANDMOTHERS house. Itis a traditional peasant house. Small but well kept. The front door is open. It is dark inside. The GRANDMOTHERS head is poking out from one side of the door. She is dressed in black so her head should be the only thing visible.

PANEL 1

INTERIOR: 1760. DAY. ATILIOS KITCHEN. ZAGOZA. UNCLE and MARTA are sat at the kitchen table. FRANCISCO stands beside UNCLE. MARTA is a severe looking women in her 50's. She squints at FRANCISCO.

MARTA
He's small. Has he been ill? He looks like he's been ill. Will he be strong enough? His duties, when he's not daubing paint for the Master, will be taxing.

UNCLE
He is strong. You will have no complaint. I vouch for him.

MARTA
Ah, but then, who are you?

PANEL 2

It is later. UNCLE has gone. MARTA holds out a plate with bread and cheese.

MARTA
Eat this, boy. Then we'll find you a place for your things.

PANEL 3

INTERIOR: 1760. DAY. CORRIDOR. ATILIOS HOUSE. ZAGOZA. A long dark corridor. Bright light through a window to one side. Dust motes fly in the air. Dark shadows outside of the beam through the window. MARTA walks towards us with FRANCISCO behind. In front of them sit three children - all girls - side by side on chairs set against the wall. They sit upright with straight backs. All look severe.

MARTA
His daughters.

PANEL 3

MARTA and FRANCISCO stand in front of a heavy oak door. They are seen from the waist up - mostly in silouette. The door takes up the rest of the panel.

MARTA
His studio.

PANEL 4

INTERIOR: 1760. DAY. STUDIO. ATILIOS HOUSE. ZAGOZA. A view of the studio through the now open door. It is sparcely decorated. The floor is bare. The strongest feature is the sunlight. This should contrast very strongly with the darkness of the rest of the panels on the page. A number of windows run the length of the left side of the room. A long heavy table is positioned on the right hand side. On it are many items of painting equipment - all very neatly placed... placed with efficiency in mind. In the centre of the room stands an easel. On it sits a large blank canvas.

PANEL 5

INTERIOR: 1760. DAY. CELLAR. ATILIOS HOUSE. ZAGOZA. MARTA and FRANCISCO are walking down the cellar steps.  MARTA is in front holding a lit candle positioned in a candle-holder. This should be the only source of light in the panel and the visibility of things should weaken further away from the light.

PANEL 6

MARTA points to a cellar corner.

MARTA
Put your things here. This is where you'll sleep. You're free today. Tomorrow, not so much.

PANEL 1

The panel should take up the whole page. It should show a montage of daytime village scenes... The good things that people do... A Blacksmith, Shopkeeper, Potter, Teacher and Priest going about their work. The impression is that things should be furtive, sinful. Small acts of cruelty; perversion, rebellion, theft etc.

PPANEL 1
EXTERIOR: DAY. 2013. GRANDMOTHERS GARDEN.
ISABEL is looking at SAUL. She looks a little embarrassed but also a little doubtful of SAUL. He is looking at her.
SAUL
What?
Panel 2
We see the front of the GRANDMOTHERS house. Itis a traditional peasant house. Small but well kept. The front door is open. It is dark inside. The GRANDMOTHERS head is poking out from one side of the door. She is dressed in black so her head should be the only thing visible.
GRANDMOTHER
So Isabel... Are you coming in? You and your half finished lump of clay.
Panel 3
INTERIOR: DAY. 2013. GRANDMOTHERS KITCHEN.
SAUL is sitting at the kitchen table. GRANDMOTHER is putting a plate of bread on the table. SAUL has a soup bowl in front of him.
SAUL
What did you mean...clay?
GRANDMOTHER
Be quiet. Eat your food.
SAUL
Where's Isabel?
GRANDMOTHER
Upstairs. Praying for common sense if she's wise.
Panel 4
SAUL is still seated. He is looking up at the standing GRANDMOTHER. She is looking down at him with a gimlet eye.
SAUL
Upstairs?
GRANDMOTHER
Yes. Don't get any ideas, golem. Not if you know whats good for you.
Panel 5
SAUL is sat looking embarrassed and a little guilty. He is very uncomfortable.
SAUL
I wasn't thinking... I wouldn't...
GRANDMOTHER
Why? Is there something wrong with my Grandaughter? Not pretty enough for you, fat man?
Panel 6
ISABEL is standing in the kitchen doorway. We see her from behind. GRANDMOTHER is walking towards the doorway... Towards us. She is smiling in an amused and evil manner. In the background SAUL is still sat at the table, looking uncomfortable.
ISABEL
Grandmother...
GRANDMOTHER
(whispers) Pah! You want to take all the fun out of an old womans life?

SAUL is now seeing the same scenes as Page 188. He has now been transported as an unwilling witness to the events of 1936. He should be stumbling through the graveyard. The dead are all around him. 'Shades' and 'mythic beasts' are seen. None interfere with him. He exists on 'another plane' (whatever!). He reaches the rear wall of the graveyard. He leans on it, gasping with both arms outstretched supporting him. He looks into the orchard.</Text>

At the other end of his path is a dark haired, elfin, girl. She is sitting on his doorstep. She sits under her umbrella, holding a book.

EDWARD
I lied. I said I was still writing for the Newspaper.
Panel 4
RICHARD
So she doesn't know you're here to fight?

OLD FEMALE NEIGHBOUR
Morning Mr Kramer. How are you this fine day?
SAUL
Fine. All fine... (under his breath) ...And if you don't turn that bloody mower off I'm going to give you the sharpest bloody enema you have ever bloody had.
Panel 3
The neighbour, oblivious, continues to mow her lawn while Saul glowers at her, imagining vengeance.
Panel 4
Saul settles back into reading. He is fully absorbed. He drinks.
Panel 5
Saul is suddenly standing bolt upright. The chair has fallen over. His eyes are wide and his mouth is wide open in a ridiculous fashion. His glass has fallen from his hand and spilt red wine onto his crotch and thighs. He still holds the open diary.
SAUL
Oh Francisco... you beautiful beneficent bastard!

The road down into the valley stretches out in front of them. Past the Militiaman you can see a panorama of yellow, green and orange fields, farm buildings and pearl grey villages. The mountains frame the picture on both sides. It is beautiful.

PAGE 8 1936
Panel 1
EXTERIOR: 1936. BARCELONA. NIGHT. VERY BUSY STREET.
A view from the first floor balcony of a hotel. Over the two mens shoulders we see a mixture of trams, cars and mule carts. Old women shopping at stalls on the crowded square, shouting to make themselves heard. Straggling groups of children running between the traffic. Lean cats and mangy dogs, beggars and itinerant vendors. And everywhere, makeshift uniforms... khaki and boiler suit blue.
CAP
Barcelona 1936. A city given over to the proletariat.
Panel 2
EXTERIOR: NIGHT. BAR.
EDWARD and RICHARD sit opposite each other at an outside table. There are three wine bottles on the table. Two are empty and the third is half full. They look happy and content. Perhaps a little overwhelmed by the sights around them. In the background, a protest march is happening. Militia march with red banners saying "Ni Campesinos con hambre". At the rear of the march young children dressed in militia uniforms march. Their banners read "Queremos escuelas laicos". The youngest is about six and sucks her thumb.
Panel 3
INTERIOR: NIGHT. CABARET BAR.
EDWARD and RICHARD sit laughing amongst many others on a bench. Theirs is one of many other parallel benches in this smoky room. At the end of the room is a stage. On it a group of women dancers perform. A band perform to one side. The men in the audience whistle through their fingers. Many stand and shout to their friends in other rows. It is cheerful bedlam.
RICHARD
They dance very... artistically. La revolución is quite the aphrodisiac.

She lays a gentle finger upon his hand.

PAGE 10 1936
Panel 1

Indeed. Some liked it so much they decided to stay for good.

RICHARD
I can't see anyone.
EDWARD
We can never see anyone. They're too far away to hit us.
Panel 2
RICHARD
So why do they shoot at us?
EDWARD
Same reason we shoot at them. To remind ourselves there's a war on. Justifies the fuss and bother.
Panel 3
Down on the valley floor men continue to farm. EDWARD and RICHARD watch the farmers, harvesting, creating food to sustain new life while on either side of the valley others contemplated the taking of it.
Panel 4
RICHARD
Odd. The way they potter on regardless... you know, in spite of all this.

I follow her around our home, stumbling foot to foot with love. She is porcelain to me. Impossible not to touch.
Panel 3
CAP
And I cannot touch her enough. Often to her annoyance. The sight of her at the sink draws my hands to her breasts, her thighs. An abrasive act of worship.
Panel 4
CAP
I want to swim through her love the way my children do, effortless and ripe.
Panel 5 
CAP
And so I call her, many times a day, just to hear her voice. Each call is a weight upon her. My desire, a paranoia, forces the breath from her.

Others were whitewashed or made to wriggle along a stretch of public road on their stomachs... The infamous 'crawling order'.

I cannot sleep, so I walk. The sky is getting lighter, even among the dark trees.
Panel 2
CAP
It is quiet and lonely. I feel cut off from everything and everyone here.
CAP
I follow the path towards the river. My thoughts drift as I walk.
Panel 3
A rotund young Fascist soldier sits with his back to a tree, eating a hunk of brown bread.
Panel 4
CAP
I stand for a few moments watching him. The bread crumbles in his hands and he leans forward to pick up the shards fallen to the ground.
CAP
I don't know what to do. I think I might tiptoe into the trees and find my way back.
Panel 5
CAP
He turns and sees me. His hand is raised, a crust halfway to his open mouth.
Panel 6
CAP
He stands and we look at each other for a long time.

SAUL and ISABEL sit by a camp fire. The only light comes from the flames. SAUL looks pensive.
SAUL
Isabel, I don't... I don't understand what happened today.
Panel 2
ISABEL
The forest is old. The trees have their roots in another time... Another way.
SAUL
I don't know what that means. And the wolf?
Panel 3
ISABEL
You are unhappy. The wolf, the others, want to be near you. To enjoy you.
Panel 4
SAUL
No. No. Still no clearer.
Panel 5
ISABEL
Don't worry. I am your guide.
Panel 6
SAUL
You're doing this on purpose aren't you.

CAP
His eyes never leave me as he raises the pistol. I can see his hand shake.
Panel 3
CAP
He fires once, wildly. And misses, hitting a tree off to my right.

The fear has overtaken him. He turns and runs. His weapon falls to the ground.
Panel 5
CAP
I kneel, my rifle at my shoulder. I aim and fire. I also miss.
Panel 6
EDWARD is running down the forest path.
CAP
I feel a great anger. His trying to end my life an insult.
PAGE 39 2002
Panel 1
EXTERIOR: 2002. DAY. GRAVEYARD.
All the graves are in poor condition - weed choked, and stripped of their marble. Some are broken.
CAP
It is strange how once graves are abandoned, the people in them are truly dead.
Panel 2
Kate is walking among the graves.
Panel 3
Kate stands in front of a gravestone. She reads the inscription, which is of a child - a girl. The inscription should read "Rebecca Caplin. Our little angel. Born 13/06/1903 Died 24/12/1906."

CAP
Over the next few days we lied to each other.
CAP
I told her I understood. Kate said she believed me.
CAP
After that we didn't speak of our daughter again.

Panel 2
We see the soldiers face. His eyes are wide open in fear.
FASCIST SOLDIER
Don't kill me. Please don't kill me. Please!
Panel 3
EDWARD is sitting on the soldiers chest. He holds the hunting knife over the soldiers face.
EDWARD
Quiet down. If you don't I'll take your ear.
Panel 4
EDWARD is looking at the soldier quizzically. His head is leant to one side.
EDWARD
Why?
FASCIST SOLDIER
I don't... I don't understand...
EDWARD
Why did you shoot? Why did you try to kill me?
Panel 5
FASCIST SOLDIER
I didn't want to. I didn't want to do it!

Panel 1
EXTERIOR: 2013. NIGHT. DEEP IN THE FOREST.
SAUL is walking through the forest. There is no light but moonlight.
Panel 2
We see a pool of light. It should be small amongst the trees. A naked figure sits within it. It looks like ISABEL.
Panel 3
ISABEL squats naked. She is urinating on the ground. Her hair is up, one lock used to wrap the others. SAUL stands transfixed.
Panel 4
ISABEL stands. In the lamplight she is beautiful... Botticelli's Venus. SAUL can be seen in the background. She is looking in the opposite direction to him.
Panel 5
SAUL walks back through the trees. His hand rests on the trunk of a tree. Next to his hand is a carving of a lion.
Panel 6
We see ISABEL, still naked... She is smiling serenely - someone with a secret.
ISABEL
Padre Celestial y Madre de la luna. Él es como un niño. Ayúdame con él.
PAGE 44 1936
Panel 1
EXTERIOR: 1936. DAWN. FOREST PATH. DEEP IN THE FOREST.

Panel 2
EDWARD dips his left hand fingers into the blood on the soldiers chest.
Panel 3
EDWARD puts his fingers to his mouth and tastes the blood. It should seem that he's doing it as an investigation... quizzically.
Panel 4
EDWARD looks up and sees the she-wolf sitting quietly in front of him. It looks placid, but hungry.
Panel 5
EDWARD smiles at the wolf.
EDWARD
Woof woof.

Panel 5
CAP
She turns to me as I lie on the bed.
KATE
Don't you have something better to do than to watch me?
Panel 6
SAUL and KATE are standing face to face, close together. He is cupping her naked left breast gently in his hand. Her face is turned to one side, partially away from SAUL and the reader. Both their expressions should be neutral.
CAP
I know that she does not want me. That I will take her anyway.
CAP
And that she will let me. With brittle regret. A turning away.

Help me with him.
ALODIA
Put him in the library. The day-bed.

Panel 2
SERAFIN
How far to the next village?
MATEO
The man said we were lost.
Panel 3
CALVINO
Possibly lost. And with no food.

Fifty or so km's. If we are on the right track.
CALVINO
I can't march that far without something to eat.

EDWARD
We should find another shepherd.

SAUL
Isabel, last night...
ISABEL
Yes.
Panel 3
They have stopped walking. SAUL and ISABEL standing in front of each other. Saul is looking down, anywhere but her face.
SAUL

Peeing? I don't...
SAUL
Urinating.
ISABEL
Ah.

SAUL
I, er... You were beautiful... Oh Christ.
ISABEL
Oh.
SAUL
I watched you.
Panel 5
ISABEL leans towards SAUL and kisses him on the cheek.
Panel 6
SAUL watches ISABEL walk off along the track. He is completely dumbfounded.
ISABEL
I know.

ANBESSA
In the clearing. Moving single file.

PAGE 51 2005
Panel 1
INTERIOR: 2005. NIGHT. HOTEL BAR. CONFERENCE. OSLO.
SAUL is sitting in at semi-circular booth table with four other people. He looks like a man suffering but too polite to show it. A sign on the wall should read 'Radison Hotel Oslo'. There are many drinks - full and empty on the table.
Panel 2
Everyone at the table is listening to a drunken delegate who is in the middle of telling a story.
CAP
I first met 'Professor Arsehole' - dont know his actual name - at last years Klee conference in Paris. He told the same boring story then too.
PROFESSOR ARSEHOLE
...and so I told him that if it was good enough for Pollock it was good enough for me!
Panel 3
Everyone at the table is laughing. SAUL is rising from his seat. He is not laughing.
SAUL
I'm going to the bar.
Panel 4
Saul is standing at the bar. The barman is in the background preparing drinks. A woman is standing next to SAUL. We cannot see her face.
PROSTITUTE
Would you like to buy me a drink?
Panel 5
INTERIOR: 2005. NIGHT. HOTEL LIFT. CONFERENCE. OSLO.
SAUL and the PROSTITUTE are standing side by side in the hotel lift. They both face the reader. The walls of the lift are mirrored. Both people look neutral. A modern day 'American Gothic'.

Panel 2
CAP
Others are worried but I am calm. I am happier here, in these mountains and with these men, than I have ever been.
Panel 3
CAP
There is a purity to it. A simplicity of motive. Action and consequence more closely linked than before.
Panel 4
CAP
During the night I am visited by each of the men I have killed. I explain this purity to them. I engage them in reasoned debate...
Panel 5
CAP
...and they understand. Their acceptance a vindication. A denial of my decay.

GABRIEL and FRANCISCO are standing on the balcony. GABRIEL is hanging a small mirror on a nail on the balcony frame. There is a table and three chairs on the balcony. Underneath the mirror is a small round topped table holding a bowl of water, a shaving brush, a cake of soap and a cut-throat razor.
GABRIEL
Sit.
Panel 2
GABRIEL uses a shaving brush to apply soap to his face. The frame should show him applying soap with his right-hand to the left underside of his chin.
GABRIEL
So, boy, you want to paint?
FRANCISCO
I do, sir.
Panel 3
CAP
The Master sets the blade at an angle and began. The razor rasps on the hard hairs of his throat.
CAP
Whenever the foam on the blade grew too large, he wiped it carefully with a piece of cloth.
Panel 4
GABRIEL
Look around. What do you see?
Panel 5
Close up of the sunlit foam on the blade of the razor held in GABRIELS hand.
FRANCISCO
I see Mother of Pearl. On your blade.
Panel 6
GABRIEL holds the razor up to the sun. He is completely focused on the foam. He should look quietly satisfied with FRANCISCOS response.
PAGE 54 1936
Panel 1
EXTERIOR: 1936. NIGHT. RIVER BANK. DEEP IN THE FOREST.
EDWARD and the other men are standing by the side of a wide river. Pieter lays on the stretcher on the ground. By the side of the river is a post and attached to it by a metal self and a thick chain is a bell, its clapper hanging down below it.
CALVINO
Like I said, the boatmans cottage is on the other side. See the light from the fire?
Panel 2
SERAFIN
It is a risk.
SERGEANT
Agreed. But the river is too wide to swim. And with Pieter... Anbessa, ring the bell.
Panel 3
Anbessa stands ringing the bell. The background is a moonlit river stretching out to the other shore. The boatmans home is lit from the fire. The moon should be full and reflected in the water.
Panel 4
Rear view of a row-boat big enough to carry the seven men. A figure is in the middle of the boat. It is rowing. It should be wearing a hooded cloak and be indistinct in the moonlight. You should not be able to discern its sex.
Panel 5
RICHARD and EDWARD are standing looking out towards the boat. The boat should be visible in the background... Its prow pointing towards the men.
RICHARD
He's coming.
Panel 6
EDWARDS face should be squinting slightly as he looks out towards the boat.
EDWARD
Actually, I think 'he' may be a 'she'.

SAUL
I said... I'm trying to sleep.

SERGEANT
We want to cross.
Panel 3
A view of the ferry woman. She is a tall woman, old and ugly. She has long grey hair. Despite her age, she looks strong - arm and character.
FERRY WOMAN
You must be the genius of the group. You rang the bell. Of course you want to cross. What else is there?
Panel 4
RICHARD
What is your price?
FERRY WOMAN
A single coin... But you yourself cannot cross.
Panel 5
RICHARD
What are you talking about? Of course I'm crossing over.
FERRY WOMAN
But not in my boat. The other side is not a place for you.
Panel 6
EDWARD
He'll be coming with me.
Panel 7
The FERRY WOMAN scrutinises EDWARDS face shrewdly.
FERRY WOMAN
Yes. I believe the poor boy will. Get in the boat. All of you.

Panel 1
EXTERIOR: 2005. DAY. RAINING. MUDDY RUGBY PITCH. LOCAL RUGBY CLUB.
SAUL is tackling an opposition player. The tackle is a strong one and the both players are grimacing from the hit. They, like any other rugby players seen on this page, should be smeared with mud.
CAP
My guilt weeps and bleeds. A dead thing come to life.
Panel 2
INTERIOR: 2005. DAY. HOTEL ROOM. CONFERENCE. OSLO.
SAUL is lying naked on his back on the bed. The semi-clothed PROSTITUTE is placing a condom on his penis.
Panel 3
EXTERIOR: 2005. DAY. RAINING. MUDDY RUGBY PITCH. LOCAL RUGBY CLUB.
We see a close up of the left hand side of the scrum. SAUL is in the loose head prop position so his face is the one nearest to the reader and is the only one that is clearly defined. The others are partial or mostly in shadow. The effort on the faces should be visible.
CAP
I welcome a measured pain. A punishment not quite worthy of the crime. But a punishment none the less.
Panel 4
INTERIOR: 2005. DAY. HOTEL ROOM. CONFERENCE. OSLO.
SAUL and the PROSTITUTE are having sex. She is sitting astride him.
CAP
I feel the brush of fresh fingertips against my arm, my throat, my thighs. Illicit... over-ripe and blue-green bruised.
Panel 5
EXTERIOR: 2005. DAY. RAINING. MUDDY RUGBY PITCH. LOCAL RUGBY CLUB.
A line out viewed from the touchline. SAUL is third from the front on the right hand side of the panel. He should look expectant. The ball is in the air, between the two rows of men.
CAP
Our married faces, sour and bloated in each days light, know a truth yet recognised.
Panel 6
INTERIOR: 2005. DAY. HOTEL ROOM. CONFERENCE. OSLO.
The PROSTITUTE is kneeling on the bed. SAUL has entered her from behind. Her face should be large in the left hand side of the panel. She should look disengaged - not bored, but professional. SAUL should have the same expression on his face as he did in Panel 1.
CAP
In my sleep I heard a mother wolf and woke gulping and wet cheeked.
CAP
We are broken and disfigured... down here, playing in the muck.
PAGE 58 1936
Panel 1
EXTERIOR: 1936. NIGHT. ON THE RIVER. DEEP IN THE FOREST.
The boat is moving slowly through the water. The river seems wide. There is some mist on the water. Small patches of wake are seen around the tips of the oars as they breach the water.
Panel 2
RICHARD
How long will the crossing take?
Panel 3
The old woman looks sardonic. She waves a hand at the far river bank.
FERRY WOMAN
As long as it takes. Do you dislike my dreary coast?
Panel 4
CALVINO's hand trails over the side of the boat and his fingers dip into the water.
FERRY WOMAN
You might want to reconsider that my friend.
Panel 5
Dark shapes can be seen in the water around the boat. The moonlight does not allow us to see what they are, but occasionally the broad back of something breaks the surfaces for a moment.
Panel 6
The men look nervously at the water around the boat. Calvino has moved his hand from the water.
FERRY WOMAN
Settle down. You lot are more dangerous than anything out there.
FERRY WOMAN
Well, one of you is anyway.

GABRIEL
Not yet... No matter. You will. I will teach you.
Panel 3
INTERIOR: 1760. DAY. CHURCH OF SANTIAGO. VALLADOLID.
GABRIEL and FRANCISCO stand side by side in front of a rerodos, (a screen or decoration behind the altar in a church), depicting the adoration of the magi.
GABRIEL
An artist must know the materials of those that came before, if he is to know his own and how to use them.
FRANCISCO

GABRIEL
And later Christian Monks... yes,  Holy Fathers... wrote of the use of drying oils... walnut, the poppy, hempseed, castor, and linseed.
FRANCISCO
For what purpose?
GABRIEL
To varnish their pictures and to protect against water. Yes?
Panel 6
FRANCISCO
And for paint?
GABRIEL
Good. Now we come to it.

Panel 6
The men stand looking at the FERRY WOMAN's back as she walks off towards her home. They look puzzled and confused. EDWARD is holding the coin in his hand and frowning at it.
RICHARD
Thank you for helping us.

ISABEL
Give it to me. All of it!
Panel 5
ISABEL
Is this everything? ¿Todo?
SAUL
Yes. All of it.
Panel 6
ISABEL pours the contents of the two bottles onto the ground... One in each hand. SAUL looks on embarrassed, trying to conceal his addicts surliness at watching the drink wasted.

FRANCISCO is standing in the middle of the pig sty. He is scraping pig shit into a loose pile in one corner. GABRIEL stands on the outside of the sty leaning on its fence with his arms folded.
GABRIEL
Now boy... The oldest Mediterranean civilizations, the Greeks, Romans and Egyptians have extensively used painting techniques based on mixtures of encaustic, likely rich in bee wax, mineral pigments such as iron, and tempera.
FRANCISCO
Yes Master.
Panel 2
GABRIEL is pointing a finger upwards to give emphasis to his point. FRANCISCO is still shovelling shit.
GABRIEL
You know tempera? Francisco. No? Incredible! It is a fluid mixture of binder, water and vegetable oils.
FRANCISCO
Yes Master.
Panel 3
GABRIEL has his hands clasped behind his back and is pacing from the left of the panel to the right. He is concentrating on his 'speech'. Behind him FRANCISCO is shovelling.
GABRIEL
At the end of the Roman Empire and up to the 15th century, this ancient technique was lost...
FRANCISCO
So why are...?
GABRIEL
...so now oil paint became what we artists use. Yes? But it has been a long journey. In Italy and Greece, olive oil was used. But the drying time was excessively long.
GABRIEL
One could not get our patrons to sit still long enough. Eh? No, not at all.
FRANCISCO
Yes Master.
Panel 4
GABRIEL has his hands clasped behind his back and is pacing from the right of the panel to the left. Behind him FRANCISCO is shovelling.
GABRIEL
Now, about 1410, Jan Van Eyck, Flemish but still a good painter,  developed a stable varnish based on linseed oil as the binder of mineral pigments.
GABRIEL
His secret was a mixture of piled glass, calcined bones and mineral pigments in linseed oil, maintained for a long time in a viscous state at boiling temperature. You understand? Francisco?
FRANCISCO
Yes Master.
Panel 5
GABRIEL has his hands clasped behind his back and is pacing from the left of the panel to the right. Behind him FRANCISCO is shovelling.
GABRIEL
Now Francisco. After Van Eyck, Antonello da Messina introduced a new improvement. He cleverly added a lead oxide to the pigment-oil mixtures to increase their siccative property. Impressive, yes?
FRANCISCO
Yes Master. Very.
Panel 6
We see Gabriels back as he walks away from the sty. The left part of the panel is filled with FRANCISCO's face. He looks resigned.
GABRIEL
Enough for today! But there is more, much more! A world of beauty!
FRANCISCO
Yes Master.
GABRIEL
And don't miss the shit in the corners. Get it all out.
FRANCISCO
Yes Master.

Panel 4
PIETER
The last words. The benediction. Please.

A beautiful girl - around 19 years old - is laying on a chez longue. She is dressed only in a robe - held below her shoulders but exposing the tops of her arms and a lot of cleavage. She is posing in a mildly seductive and confident manner. She looks intelligent and a little mischevious.
Panel 3
GABRIEL
You must pay particular attention to her skin. Look at the light play on her shoulders. Her neck. Look!

RICHARD
What is that place? What value has it? Why would they bomb?
MATEO
It is a retreat,  a library of sorts. At least I think so. I don't know for sure.
Panel 5
RICHARD is horrified. The idea of destroying a library is offending him almost as much as the idea that there are people under that bombing.
RICHARD
We should go up there and see if we can help!
Panel 6
EDWARD is laying on his back on the ground. He is enjoying the rest. RICHARD is standing, looking at him...  He looks confused and numb.
EDWARD

Panel 4
EDWARD and the others are surrounded by a number of other bandits. Without exception, they are all fat, strong men like TRISTÁN. Some are middle aged, some are young but all appear strong and are well armed.

TRISTÁN
It is nearly dinner time. It is not far and it will soon rain and then the wind will become strong.

TRISTÁN has his back to them and is busy doing something on the other side of the cave. The cave is full of stacked food and barrels. A long table stretches along the side of the cave. It is piled high with food and looks like a butchers table. From the ceiling hang cured hams, sausages, pheasants, pigeons and rabbits.
Panel 6
The men are eating food from the large bowls. TRISTÁNs men They using large spoons and the food is dripping from the sides of their mouths. There should be something off about their faces - they should be slightly malformed. Mouths slightly distorted. They should be taking no pleasure in the food and their eyes should be black - no whites around the pupils. TRISTÁNs wife has her hand on CALVINOs arm. She is flirting - with her eyes. He is very receptive.
TRISTÁN WIFE
Eat. It is my pleasure.

TRISTÁN is holding the long sharp hunting knife. CALVINO is cowering in the corner of the cave looking very frightened. TRISTÁNs wife is also advancing towards CALVINO holding a knife. The other men are standing around. All the faces, other than CALVINOs, should be distorted in the same way as Panel 6 of PAGE 76.

There are three beautiful, completely naked, young women, sitting high on the rampart walls over the open raised metals gate through the walls. They are holding large baskets of over-ripe fruit. The men are smiling, and wave as they approach.
Panel 5
EXTERIOR. 1936. DAY. IN FRONT OF THE VILLAGE WALLS. DEEP IN THE FOREST.
The women aggressively throw the over-ripe fruit down at the men. The men stand under a rain of rotten fruit, protecting themselves as best they can.
RICHARD
Why the devil are they throwing things at us!
SERGEANT
I don't know but run! Run through the gate!
Panel 6
We see a rear view of the three women. Each has a large pair of bat-like wings. Two have folded wings, the other has open wings - like a heron flexing its wings. Their baskets are mostly empty. They look content. The men can be seen in the distance, walking down the road into the village. The women are looking at each other. Their eyes are now gone and their eyes are running with blood - just on their cheeks. (The wings and their bloody eyes are not visible in the previous panels).
THIRD WOMAN
I'm bored. What shall we do now?

Panel 1
EXTERIOR. 1936. DAY. PLAZA. VILLAGE.
The men stand in the centre of the plaza. There are no signs of life from the village at all. The buildings look in poor condition and have not been maintained. They do not, however, look derelict. Just uncared for.
MATEO
Where is everyone?
Panel 2
SERAFIN is looking at the bar on the edge of the plaza.
SERAFIN
I could do with a drink.
SERGEANT
And food. Come on.
SERAFIN
Thank God.
EDWARD
I want to find someone first. Richard?
Panel 3
EXTERIOR. 1936. DAY. STREET. VILLAGE.
We see RICHARD and EDWARD, from the rear, walking along a narrow street. There are houses on both sides of the street. The street slopes downwards steeply. Any streets visible should slope downwards.
Panel 4
EXTERIOR. 1936. DAY. RIVERBANK. VILLAGE.
EDWARD and RICHARD stand at the end of the street. Our view is over the shoulders. We see the, (200 or so), village inhabitants. They are by, and in, the river that flows through the village at its lowest point.
Half the villagers are on the banks of the river. They are in a state of turmoil. Half, (the prodigal), are feverishly throwing food, drink and money into the air. The other half, (the avaricious), are scrabbling at their feet, grasping the things thrown by the prodigal. They paw at the prodigal for more. No-one is happy - there should be a desperate, hysterical, air to it. The prodigal and the avaricious should look like they are arguing with each other.
The remainder of the villagers are in the river. They are fighting - punching and biting each other. At the edges of the river, in the mud and froth churned up by the fighting, lay exhausted villagers - indolent and uncaring.
Overall, the panel should be bigger than the others - perhaps the width of the page. It should have a Heronymous Bosch feel to it. A stone bridge, in the middle of the panel, should cross the narrow river.
Panel 5
EXTERIOR. 1936. DAY. BRIDGE. RIVER. VILLAGE.
EDWARD and RICHARD stand on the bridge over the river. EDWARD leans on the parapet of the bridge with his arms crossed. He looks quietly amused. RICHARD stands a little back from the edge of the bridge. He looks shocked and uncomfortable, as if he does not want to get too close to the madness of the villagers below.
RICHARD
This is horrible. What is going on?
EDWARD
No idea. But my money is on the big bloke in the red shirt. Hell of a right hand.
Panel 6
RICHARD looks a little frightened of EDWARD.

Panel 1
INTERIOR. 1767. DAY. DUKES DRAWING ROOM. VALLADOLID.
FRANCISCO and GABRIEL stand side by side in the Dukes imposing and ornate room.
Panel 2
FRANCISCO is nervous. GABRIEL is nervous on his behalf. There is money and reputation riding on the next few minutes.
GABRIEL
I recommended you for this commission. It could be a good move for you if it goes well.
GABRIEL
Wipe your shoe.
Panel 3
FRANCISCO is kneeling, rubbing his shoe with his hankerchief.
FRANCISCO
Does the Duke know it is my first?
GABRIEL
Of course, but I convinced him you would do a good job.
Panel 4
GABRIEL looks like he's convincing himself. FRANCISCO is looking at him a little askance.
GABRIEL
You will do a good job, won't you?
Panel 5
The two men are looking straight ahead, and not at each other.
GABRIEL
By the way, he has a daughter. Pretty, I hear.
Panel 6
GABRIEL
And, if I hear anything else, I'll have your balls hanging from my mantelpiece in a little bag.
GABRIEL
Stand up straight. He's coming.

Panel 1
EXTERIOR. 1936. DAY. PLAZA. VILLAGE.
EDWARD and RICHARD are walking towards the village bar.
Panel 2
INTERIOR. 1936. DAY. BAR. VILLAGE.
The men are in the bar. They are seated at a table. With them is a rheumy old priest. He is drunk and looks like its his normal state. He has wine stains on the front of his clothing. EDWARD and RICHARD stand at the edge of the table.
Panel 3
SERAFIN
Meet our new friend, Father Ramon. He is not a good Catholic.
FATHER RAMON
I am a splendid Catholic. The Church is not a good Catholic however.
MATEO
Good luck telling them that.
Panel 4
SERGEANT
The good Father has very kindly been describing the struggle between a good, spiritual world of light, and an evil, material world of darkness.
FATHER RAMON
Yes. Through an ongoing process which takes place in human history, light is gradually removed from the world of matter and returned to the world of light from which it came.
Panel 5
RICHARD
So you're saying we - as matter - will end in darkness?
FATHER RAMON
Yes. I'm afraid so.
EDWARD
Might be something in it. Have you looked at the world recently.
RICHARD
Very funny.
Panel 6
ANBESSA is looking up and pointing upwards with his finger.
ANBESSA
We should watch out.
RICHARD
Why?
ANBESSA
Two heretics in one room at the same time. Seems like tempting fate?
RICHARD
Fine. A room full of comedians.
PAGE 85 2013
Panel 1
INTERIOR: 2013. NIGHT. FERRY WOMANS HOUSE. RIVER BANK. DEEP IN THE FOREST.
ISABEL standing by the side of SAULS bed. She is naked, looking down at him in the bed. He is delerious and blind to anything around him.
Panel 2
The panel should take up the majority of the page. SAUL is having a surreal delerium dream of, (in no particular order and in the form of a mixed montage/collage): the forest; his bed; FRANCISCO as a young man in his twenties; a dark painting;  SAULS violently beating KATE; FRANCISCOS witch painting; war scenes from EDWARDS story; the she-wolf in soldiers clothing; a forest sex scene with two men and a woman - all naked, (one man has a leopards mask face, one a lion mask, and the woman has the she-wolfs face mask); three women flying around a rampart with red bloody eyes, the dead shepherd, a murder of crows, a church enthusiastically on fire, a tree with multiple bodies hanging from it, FRANCISCO's carriage with a broken wheel and a middle aged FRANCISCO standing by it, ISABELS Grandmother as a young woman and an old woman. SAULS and ISABELS both holding hands with their five year old daughter. Future and past scenes from stories in the novel. It should be mixed up and should not make sense.
Panel 3
INTERIOR: 2013. DAY. FERRY WOMANS HOUSE. RIVER BANK. DEEP IN THE FOREST.
SAUL and ISABEL sleep side by side in the bed, naked from the waist up. Quiet and content. His fever has broken.
Panel 4
EXTERIOR: 2013. DAY. FERRY WOMANS HOUSE. RIVER BANK. DEEP IN THE FOREST.
ISABEL and the FERRY WOMAN are standing outside the house. Each is holding a coffee cup. SAUL is sleeping.
FERRY WOMAN
He looks better. More peaceful.
ISABEL
I believe so. I think we'll be leaving in a day or so.
PAGE 86 1936
Panel 1
INTERIOR. 1936. DAY. BAR. VILLAGE.
The men stand next to the fountain which is in the centre of the plaza. They are drinking wine. The mood is subdued. The strangeness of the proceedings in the village has worried them. The priest is still with them. He is very drunk.
SERAFIN
So what now, jefe?
SERGEANT
There is nothing we can do here? I think we gather supplies and move on.
Panel 2
RICHARD
We just take what we need?
SERGEANT
Yes.
RICHARD
It's stealing.
EDWARD
It's practical.
Panel 3
FATHER RAMON
Take me with you.
SERGEANT
Not possible.
EDWARD
Not practical.
Panel 4
FATHER RAMON
Please. I have been here a very long time.
MATEO
How long, Father?
FATHER RAMON
What is the year?
Panel 5
RICHARD
The year?
FATHER RAMON
Yes. What is it?
MATEO
Father, it is the year of our Lord, 1936.
Panel 6
FATHER RAMON
Is that all?
RICHARD
Er... Yes.
FATHER RAMON
Then I have been here four hundred and twelve years.
Panel 7
The men quickly draw the conclusion that FATHER RAMON is crazy. It brings out a little compassion in the Spaniards, though not in EDWARD.
SERAFIN
Come Father. Sit down on the ground. You are tired.
FATHER RAMON
Yes. Yes I am. Bless you.
EDWARD
We need to leave. You remember there is a patrol behind us?
SERGEANT
Yes. I remember.
PAGE 87 1988
Panel 1
INTERIOR: 2007. DAY. RELATE MARRIAGE GUIDANCE OFFICE.
SAUL and KATE sit in a slightly shabby room. The room has a skylight window - it was at one time the attic in an Edwardian middle class house. On the walls are public sector posters about saving energy by turning lightbulbs off and a few dog-eared office printed notices promoting relationship happiness and compromise. This is public sector marriage guidance - no frills. SAUL and KATE sit beside each other on the kind of chairs you find in Doctors waiting rooms. Across from them sits JENNIFER - a marriage guidance counseller. A coffee table seperates them. On it sits three coffee cups - one a porcelain mug and two plastic dispenser cups. A vase of droopy, dying, flowers tops off the feeling of failure that the room exudes.
CAP
I knew that it was not going to be alright as soon as I saw the room. No relationship came back from the brink here.
Panel 2
CAP
The Counseller - Jennifer - dislikes me. As she tells us she will be impartial and objective, I can tell she wants to see me neutered...
CAP
...with something blunt.
Panel 3
CAP
She likes Kate. They bond. Against me. Against the resistant, embarrassed men that disappoint Jennifer daily in this room.
Panel 4
CAP
I don't blame her. We're an unfortunate bunch. Brought to her as a last resort.
Panel 5
SAUL has a notebook open on his knee. We see that he has drawn a turkey looking at a Christmas tree.
CAP
I squirm as my wife describes her infidelity. They look at me in tacit sisterhood. I, flacid and impotent, sit waiting for the hour to end. The first of six spendthrift hours we will spend here.
Panel 6
CAP
In the car, on the way home, Kate will tick off the appointment in her diary. A spic and span end to our ragged day.
PAGE 88 1936
Panel 1
EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS.
The men walk single file. In the background we can see the priest still sitting on the ground next to the fountain.
Panel 2
EXTERIOR:1936. NIGHT. IN THE FOREST.
We see a fox caught in a wire loop snare. The snare is around the animals back leg and the fox is gnawing at the wire.
Panel 3
EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. THE SKY ABOVE THE FOREST.
A plane in the sky. It is the plane that is hunting them.
Panel 4
EXTERIOR: 1936. NIGHT. VILLAGE PLAZA.
The panel should take up most of the page. It should be at the least the full width of the page. The priest still sits on the ground. The three young women with the bloody eye-sockets and the bat wings sit around him. One kneels on the ground next to him. The others sit behind him, on the side of the fountain in the plaza. To the other side of the priests sits the she-wolf. They stare at the reader as if positioned for a family photograph from the early 20th century. The priest is crying. They are lit by the flames coming from the buildings on all sides of the plaza. The village is on fire.
Panel 5
EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. FOREST PATH. IN THE FOREST.
We see the patrol that is searching for Edward and the rest of the men. The patrol is walking single file. Prominent in the panel should be the rear view of the back/shoulder of one of the soldiers. On it should hang the snare trap we saw in panel 2 above. We should not see the fox though. The snare should be a symbol of the hunt.
Panel 6
EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. FOREST PATH. IN THE FOREST.
We see Edward looking back over his shoulder towards us. The rest of the men move in single file along the path ahead of him. He looks concerned.
PAGE 89 1760
Panel 1
INTERIOR: 1770. NIGHT. CROWDED BAR. ZARAGOZA.
FRANCISCO is sat at a bar table with two of his friends. Well-dressed young men 'slumming it' in a lowlife bar. They are mildly drunk. The bar is very smoky. Indeed, each of the three are smoking good sized cigars. Each of the young men has a prostitute with them. FRANCISCO's is sat on his knee. The other girls are sat next to their men, but are very attentive.
PROSTITUTE
Paint me. Do I not look good to you?
FRANCISCO
Enough to eat!
Panel 2
FRANCISCO plunges his head between the PROSTITUTES ample and visible breasts. She is laughing helplessly, as is everyone at the table.
Panel 3
RODRIGO
Curb your appetite Francisco! Leave some for her next diner.
FRANCISCO
After I eat, there will be but scraps left for other men!
Panel 4
All are laughing. RODRIGO is looking at the other man, FONSO, who is raising an eyebrow and smiling. RODRIGO and FONSO are familar with, and like, FRANCISCOS ironic bragging.
RODRIGO
Ah, yes. Of course, I should have known.
FONSO
The great gastronome.
Panel 5
RODRIGO is looking sly. FONSO is laughing and clapping his hands together.
RODRIGO
I wonder whether the Duchess Florenzia would agree.
Panel 6
RODRIGO is sitting with his hands up as if defending himself. All the men are smiling, but FRANCISCO looks a little annoyed too.
FRANCISCO
No more of that. I won't hear a word held against her.
RODRIGO
It's not your word being held against her that the Duke would worry about.
FONSO
Calm down Francisco. More drink! If you're too drunk to see, you're too drunk to fight!
PAGE 90 1936
Panel 1
EXTERIOR: 1936. DAY. FOREST PATH. IN THE FOREST.
EDWARD and MATEO are hidden in foliage. They are looking at a small clearing. In the clearing are four men. Scruffy, in a mixture of multiple uniforms and peasant clothes. They are armed - but their weapons are poor rifles and look old. The men look dirty and ill-organised. MATEO is looking at the men carefully. EDWARD is smiling at MATEO.
MATEO
For us, for them, or for themselves? I cannot myself tell.
EDWARD
I would say Republican or bandits. Equally disreputable. I'll stay. Tell the others.
Panel 2
The SERGEANT and the rest of the 'platoon' are standing at the edge of the clearing. EDWARD is sitting casually on a fallen tree log with his shotgun across his knees. At his feet lays the four mens rifles. They sit in the middle of the clearing with their hands on their heads. They look nervous.
Panel 3
EDWARD, RICHARD and the SERGEANT stand off to one side of the clearing.
EDWARD
They say they're Republican. Lost. I think deserters but they say not. Anything is possible I suppose.
SERGEANT
What do we do with them? What do you think?
Panel 4
EDWARD
Apparently, they would like to come along with us.
SERGEANT
Hmm.
RICHARD
We could do with the numbers.
EDWARD
There is the patrol to deal with.
Panel 5
SERGEANT
We'll take them along.
RICHARD
They're an evil looking lot though.
Panel 6
The SERGEANT and the rest of the men are walking single file along the forest path. ANBESSA and EDWARD are bringing up the rear of the column. EDWARD is once again looking over his shoulder down the path.

SAUL, ISABEL and the FERRY WOMAN stand in front of the house. SAUL and ISABEL are wearing their backpacks.
FERRY WOMAN
Ssh... Not necessary. Keep well, and try not to wear each other out over the next few days.
Panel 2
The FERRY WOMAN is walking away back to her house. ISABEL is smirking a little. SAUL looks perplexed.
SAUL
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
FERRY WOMAN

Sitting beside each other next to the campfire. Lit by firelight.
SAUL
Er... I have to ask. When I was...indisposed. Were you..., ah... in bed with me... naked?
Panel 5
We see the two of them looking at each other - a face each side of the panel.
ISABEL
You must have dreamt that.
Panel 6
We still see the two of them looking at each other - a face each side of the panel. It should be exactly the same as Panel 5.
SAUL
Pity. I would have liked that... very much.
Panel 7
ISABEL has lent forward and has taken SAULS face in her hands. She is kissing him.

The SERGEANT and the rest of the men are walking single file along the forest path. ANBESSA and EDWARD are bringing up the rear of the column.
PACO
I can't tell whether you're more suspicious of us or whatever it is behind us.
EDWARD
I'm still mulling that over for the moment.
Panel 2
PACO
We have nothing to fear from each other.
EDWARD
Time will tell.
Panel 3
PACO
Diego. What is it we want?
DIEGO
To go home, of course. But first, back to barracks. I like lice as much as the next soldier.
EDWARD
Most amusing.
Panel 4
The SERGEANT appraches from the head of the column. MATEO is with him.
SERGEANT
We'll camp for the night soon. Mateo, scout ahead and find us a good spot.
MATEO
Yes, Jefe.
Panel 5
PACO
He calls you Jefe? Not very revolutionary. It should be comrade.
SERGEANT
He is being ironical. Comedic even.
Panel 6
PACO
I don't find it funny. Not the right amount of revolutionary zeal I think.
SERGEANT
Hmm. Yes well, right now, to me you're a revolutionary zealot whose commitment made him a deserter from the peoples army... I'd be careful about voicing your opinion.
SERGEANT
Eduardo, a moment please, in private.
Panel 7
EDWARD and the SERGEANT are stood together talking while the rest of the column is 20 or so yards ahead on the forest path.
SERGEANT
We need to talk about the patrol following us.
PAGE 93 2008
The practicalities of a grown up breakup. The settling of finance, who gets what; who moves out; double copies of all the photographs; the planning of how the children will be told; visitation rights; packing; the inevitable leaving - the taxi ride. Tears.
Montage filling the whole page.

The men are lying in the undergrowth to either side of the forest path. They are waiting to ambush the patrol following them.
RICHARD
"Midway upon the journey of our life I found myself within a forest dark, for the straight-forward pathway had been lost."
Panel 2
EDWARD is laying near RICHARD and is smiling at him.
EDWARD
Not really a time for the classics Richard.
Panel 3
We can see both RICHARD and EDWARD from behind. They are looking down the forest path. Nothing can be seen.
Panel 4
We see the men laying side by side.
RICHARD
Richard. The thing that Clara was trying to tell you. You remember? Before we came here.
EDWARD
Yes.
Panel 5
RICHARD is looking a little nervous. As if he does not know how to approach the subject.
RICHARD
She was pregnant. That was it wasn't it?
EDWARD
I believe so... now.
Panel 6
RICHARD is looking at EDWARD. EDWARD is stony-faced, looking away. He has withdrawn within himself.

To pose. I understood you were here to paint me.
FRANCISCO
Ah...yes.

FLORENCIA is looking at him. FRANCISCO is looking hurriedly around the room. FLORENCIA is looking a little knowing and is smiling in a subtle, mischievous manner.
FRANCISCO
Er... There. By the window. For the light...upon you.
Panel 4
She is being purposely off-hand. He is nervous and is finding it difficult to look directly at her.

Ah yes, Gabriel knows many wives who can empty their husbands coffers for art. He is very...convincing.

Panel 5
We see a front view of EDWARD with his shotgun raised to his shoulder. He does not fire. His face should look puzzled.
EDWARD

The men are walking downhill through the trees towards a riverbank.

The men stand in a group by the side of the river. The river is not wide and is not deep. ANBESSA is fording the river - testing whether it is too deep to cross. It is up to his waist.
Panel 3
ANBESSA has reached almost to the other side. He stands knee deep in the water. He is waving the rest onward.
ANBESSA
Come on in. But mind your balls. It is damn cold!

GM is standing on the other side of the river. She has one hand on her hips and in the other is full of herbs. She has a bag slung across her shoulder from one side to the other. More plants can be seen poking up out of the top of the bag.
GRANDMOTHER
Hey! Mind your language! There's a lady present!
ANBESSA
What! Oh sorry! I didn't see...know...
Panel 5
The men are standing on the bank laughing. They can be seen in the background. Our viewpoint is from behind GM. ANBESSA can be seen, still standing in the water, looking wide eyed and surprised.
GRANDMOTHER
Fine lot of soldiers you are. A handful of children with rifles could have killed you!

We're heading for the village up on the hill.

A sense of freedom. I'm going to be better - a finer man. This is a new chance.

SAUL and ISABEL are looking around. ISABEL is looking a little sad. The walls of the abbey are semi-flattened and look like the ruins of an ancient Roman site.

SAUL
What was this place?
ISABEL
A kind of library. My Grandmother told me that many learned men lived here... Philosophers, poets and artists. Years ago. Before the war.

SAUL is waving a finger at the ruins. He looks a little dumbfounded.
SAUL
This... in the war?
ISABEL
Yes. A great sin.
Panel 4

It looks older...ancient, really.

Who would destroy a library?
SAUL
Are we beasts?
Panel 5
ISABEL is unpacking her backpack. SAUL is looking at the sky. The sun is high and very bright. It is a beautiful day.
ISABEL
Help me with the tent. The wind is getting up and it will rain soon.
SAUL
I don't think so.
Panel 6
A view over the ruins at what looks like late dusk - but is in fact an hour later than the previous panel. We see the destroyed abbey, and a wide view of the forested valley below the treeline. In the middle of the abbey ruins is a two man tent. It should look small in the panel - the effect should be to show how small they are against the night. ISABEL and SAUL are inside it. We see their silhouettes as they have a light inside the tent. They are sitting. Around them a storm rages. The clouds are dark. The rain comes down heavily and is blown around by a strong wind.
SAUL
OK, so I may have been wrong.

RICHARD is looking across the bar. He has his hand raised, trying to attract the attention of the waiter who is serving a table in the background. EDWARD is looking attentively at the SHORT MAN. He has a cynical smile on his face.
RICHARD
I think I need more wine. A great deal more.

Part 2 - Visit the two bars - Use it as a way to show the two 'camps' in the village. Describe conversations with the rich - the hildalgos.
Panel 1
RICHARD AND EDWARD walk across the village square towards the 'poor' bar. Their conversational tone is light and a little jokey.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
I feel a little grubby after that conversation.
EDWARD
Shall we drink with the proletariat for a while?
RICHARD
We shall.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
An odd couple, don't you think?
EDWARD
I quite liked them. At least they were honest.
Panel 2
Panel 3
Panel 4
Panel 5
Panel 6
PAGE 131 2013
SAUL wakes in his room at the GM's. He rises and looks out of the window over the sunlit farm. Sees the orchard next to the church. Notices the black tree among the normal trees. He walks down the landing to take a shower, and notices through the open door, the dark painting hanging in the GM's room. He is startled and turns to see the GM looking at him. She looks at him for a moment. "If you hurt her..."
PAGE 132 1936
New group - start creating trouble - verbal - with priest in the village. Broken up by Sergeant.
PAGE 133 1988
Panel 1
INTERIOR: 1988. DAY. SAULS HOUSE. THE HALL.
Saul coming down the stairs, unkempt - hair all over the place, wearing nothing but socks and underpants.
Panel 2
He picks up letters from the floor.
Panel 3
INTERIOR: 1988. DAY. SAULS HOUSE. THE KITCHEN.
Saul standing in the kitchen looking at a fairly thick set of papers.

SAUL (CONT'D)
Bitch.
PAGE 133 1936
Act of vandalism to rich guys home - possible killing of family pet / horse and lamb?
PAGE 134 1760
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
PAGE 135 1936
Village split over reaction - use the montage approach? Or include as GM and ISABEL talking.
PAGE 136 2013
Family meal in the garden of GM's house. GM is behaving like Pilar in Hemingway. Teasing him by being severe. ISABEL is rolling her eyes at GM. We should however, be aware that the GM is working on two levels with SAUL as we know of their last conversation, but ISABEL does not. Want to get the sense of two conversations happening at the same time with the same words.
PAGE 137 1936
Action against tenant farmer - eviction of family. By rich landowner who was victim. Revenge caused by grief.
PAGE 138 1988
A succession of scenes of Saul in pubs - different pubs. He looks progressively worse in each. He is talking crap and getting aggressive. Panel 4 should show him being launched out onto the pavement by club bouncers. He should land on his face. Panel 5 should show him, very unkempt now, staggering along the road with a cut face - drenched from the rain. Panel 6 should show him, from behind, at his garden gate... Looking at Isabel sitting on his front door step, in the rain.   
PAGE 139 1936
Village splits again. More vitriolic.
PAGE 140 1760
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
PAGE 141 1936
Night time beating of Rich guys son. Near death.
PAGE 142 2013
SAUL is shown  around the village by ISABEL. ISABEL is teased about her new beau. She is laughing but SAUL is nervous. About the age gap. About the differences between them. About her self-confidence and the focus upon them. 
PAGE 143 1936
Richard and Sergeant try to step in to diffuse things. Edward is a little amused by the whole thing - detached.
PAGE 144 1760
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
PAGE 145 1936
GM and Edward discuss the deterioration. Edward appears amoral.
PAGE 146 2013
Chaperoned as they walk the hills around the village. GM and her cronies follow SAUL and ISABEL as they walk. Should look a little like the scene from Godfather II. SAUL embarrassed but ISABEL is amused by the attention and SAULs embarrassment. 
PAGE 147 1936
Discussion between leader and member of new group. Opportunity to create more problem. 
PAGE 148 1760
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
PAGE 149 1936
Murder of poor son.
PAGE 150 2013
SAUL visits the bar on his own. He is chatting to a couple of the locals - who speak English. He is asking about the history of the village, any famous visitors (painters perhaps?) and ends by asking about the civil war. Atmosphere changes. Colder. No-one wants to talk about the civil war. SAUL apologises and changes the subject. 
PAGE 151 1936
Town Council Meeting - breaks up in argument and dissension, (threat?)
PAGE 152 1760
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
PAGE 153 1936
Dark few days - Weather is getting warmer and warmer - there is a storm brewing - talk, exaggeration, plotting, drinking. Should have a few comments on heat.
PAGE 154 2013
SAUL and the GM sit in her kitchen drinking coffee. They discuss the diary. SAUL asks her how she knew where he lived. She avoids the question. SAUL comments that the diary only covers the point up to the point where EDWARD and the other men reach the village but no further. It seems unfinished even though the last page is filled.She avoids the implied question. "Good talking to you. Thanks for the information"
PAGE 155 1936
Loud discussion in poor bar. Political talk but overt. Threats. 
PAGE 156 1760
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
PAGE 157 1936
Guardia called to bar. Break things up. Arrest an outspoken young leader of poor group.
PAGE 158 2013
Growing relationship between SAUL and ISABEL. He begins to see the pleasure of the place. BUT, in one panel he should be seen looking at the painting again. There should be no words in this panel. 
PAGE 159 1936
Leader of new group bribe guardia or access to jail. Kill the arrested man in his cell and guardia policeman.
PAGE 160 1760
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
PAGE 161 1936
Outrage in village. Storm the Town Hall. Burn all landownership documents in the village square. Edward views it with amusement - the dead boy was nothing to him. The burning is futile.
PAGE 162 2013
Child comes to door. Agricultural accident. Injured man who has been caught in a machine. Being brought to GM's house. GM and ISABEL start preparations. Starts as medicinal prep, then they start to do other things - more mystical - research this. SAUL stands in the corner and becomes more and more concerned at the preparations.
PAGE 163 1936
Dusk - Rich call for the guardia. Storm the village square. Beatings. Face off.
PAGE 164 1760
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
PAGE 165 1936
Night - Nervous policeman. Fires accidentally. The villagers charge. Shooting.
PAGE 166 2013
Injured man arrives and is cared for. Partly by straight medicine. The taking of 'medicine' and addition of poltices etc. Then the two women are visited by another older woman. Older than GM.The three women then carry out a ceremony of some sort. The room becomes full of 'shades' / 'presences'. Darkness and light. Research this. It should still feel domestic though. The things used in the ceremony should be kitchen utensils etc. It should take a night and a day. The passage of time should be shown somehow. At the end of it it should be apparent that the man is weak but will live. SAUL should sleep through some of it. 
PAGE 167 1936
Evening - Villagers win through force of numbers. Beating the policeman. Pushing the rich back towards the church. Force the rich into the church and lock them in.
PAGE 168 1760
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
PAGE 169 1936
Evening - the villagers go to the rich bar and start to drink. Bitter kind of victorious mood. Free drink, euphoria create a strange mood. Happy but cruel. Bile. Wind themselves up. All involved but GM, Richard, Anbessa and Sergeant. Edward drinks and joins with New Group.
PAGE 170 2013
SAUL questions ISABEL re the accident and their actions in preparing and carrying out the 'healing'. ISABEL is a little evasive but admits that her GM (and she) is the village healer and that this has an element of witchcraft to it. The women in her family have a long tradition in this and it is passed from generation to generation. SAUL asks her if she, as a modern medical student, really believes it. She says that reality nd myth are close here. She shrugs and says that the evidence is all around them in these mountains. "Have you not seen?" SAUL says "Like in the painting?" ISABEL looks at him curiously and says "... The painting? Grandmothers painting?" 
PAGE 171 1936
Night - Drunken villagers are all over the town. The new group, including Edward, raid the church and drag out the young daughter of one of the rich. They rape her and then kill her in one of the buildings near the church.
PAGE 172 1760
FRANCISCO finishes the painting in the orchard. He is exhausted and kneels next to the painting,spent and weak. He weeps. "It is done".
PAGE 173 1936
Storm breaks - no rain - but lightning and thunder - violent - They prepare to set fire to the church.
PAGE 174 2013
GM confronts SAUL in the kitchen. "The only reason you came here is for the painting. It is avarice and ambition. SAUL blurts out enthusiasm for the painting. Its qualities. Its value. As he speaks his face should show the same deformity as the bandits in EDWARDS story. GM says "You are not resolved, not redeemed. You are as sick as when you began." SAUL notices ISABEL in the doorway. She is looking at him in a horrified way SAUL starts to go to her. GM says "Stay there!". GM slams down another diary on the kitchen table in front of him. GM - The final part of you Grandfathers diary... "Read!"  
PAGE 175 1936
Sergeant, Richard, Anbessa try to help those in church but are held back by the others and many of the villagers. Dissenting voices - the GM speaks up but is silenced. She is forced into the church along with S, R and A.
PAGE 176 1760
FRANCISCO leaving the village.
PAGE 177 1936
They set fire to church. Many stay to watch. Others cannot stand what they have done. But cowardice stops them doing anything.
PAGE 178 2013
Panel 1 - SAUL reads silently. Panel 2 - SAUL reads silently in the same pose but a tear should be running down one side of his face. Panel 3 - ISABEL should have sat down at the table with him. GM is washing pots in the background. 
PAGE 179 1936
The captured find a way to escape from the rear of the church. They run through the graveyard and climb the wall into the orchard next door. The villagers realise and go in pursuit.
PAGE 180 2013
Storm breaks - no rain - but lightning and thunder - violent. SAUL is still reading. It is getting dark, towards night and the storm is darkening the sky and the room. We should see the contrast between the 'big sky' and the small lamplit kitchen with the three people in it. SAUL reading, looking horrified. ISABEL with her hand on his shoulder and the GM doing domestic stuff. 
PAGE 181 1936
A massacre starts. The rain breaks and is pouring down. Lightning, thunder. People are running, fighting,chasing each other. Should have a Bosch feel to it.   
PAGE 182 2013
Its hot. The night is now completely black lit only by the lightning. SAUL should have his head in his hands, with the book open in front of him. He should look up at ISABEL with wide eyes. Try to invoke increasing tension. His fingers should be rigid and clawlike on the kitchen table.
PAGE 183 1936
Massacre scenes. Anbessa is killed by New Group leader. 
PAGE 184 2013
SAUL jumps to his feet. He cannot stand the heat. He cannot stand the things he is reading. "I must move... Must get outside!" He stands in the garden and has the book open in his hands. He is looking at the church - wide eyed. In the background the GM and ISABEL are standing in the doorway of the house. He starts walking towards it. Lightning flashes and the rain starts to pour down.  
PAGE 185 1936
Massacre scenes. Bodies piling up. 
PAGE 186 2013
SAUL is struggling towards the church. He is fighting the wind. He reaches the church doors and struggling, pushes them open. He runs down the aisle between the pews, past the surprised priest, and lurches towards the rear door. GM and ISABEL have followed him. He pushes the door open and is shown 1936. The massacre scene.
PAGE 187 1936
Massacre scenes. Sergeant is killed by New Group. As a group, Knives. First mythic imagery seen. 
PAGE 188 2013
SAUL is now seeing the same scenes as Page 188. He has now been transported as an unwilling witness to the events of 1936. He should be stumbling through the graveyard. The dead are all around him. 'Shades' and 'mythic beasts' are seen. None interfere with him. He exists on 'another plane' (whatever!). He reaches the rear wall of the graveyard. He leans on it, gasping with both arms outstretched supporting him. He looks into the orchard.
PAGE 189 1936
Massacre scenes. More mythic, demonic imagery present. 
PAGE 190 2013
SAUL climbs into the orchard. He sees everything but cannot prevent anything. He reads as he walks. He sees EDWARD about to kill RICHARD and cries out to try to stop it, but cannot be heard.
PAGE 191 1936
Massacre scenes. Edward kills Richard. Shoots him. Without a blink. 
PAGE 192 2013
SAUL falls down in to the mud. He is looking around himself, distraught by the carnage and depravity around him. He sees EDWARD moving through the trees and rises. Running behind him in pursuit. Massacre scenes. Mythic scenes.... All around. 
PAGE 193 1936
Massacre scenes. Mythic scenes. Images from previous stories appear - the lion, the leopard, the wolf. The scene from the dark paintings should be visible - but not too obviously. Edward spots GM. She runs.
PAGE 194 2013
???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ISABEL is running after SAUL. Through the rain. 
PAGE 195 1936
GM is running through the trees. Edward is chasing her, hunting her. He is a few yards behind her when her shoe falls off. Without thinking he bends and picks it up. She has backed up to a tree - the suicide tree. He has a moment of clarity - of realization - as he stands holding out her shoe to the GM. He looks around - horrified at what is being done and his part in it.
PAGE 196 2013
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
PAGE 197 1936
The New group are standing around Edward and the GM. They want to have 'fun' with the GM. Edward kills them. He sits down with his back to the tree. The killing is finished. They are alone in the Orchard. We can see villagers stumbling from the orchard - head in hands - hiding their faces from each other.  
PAGE 198 2013
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
PAGE 199 1936
Possibly pix Page 200 and 201 together. Panel by Panel - 1936 and 2013 together. Would be an interesting way to quicken the pace of the text and to tell the two stories at the same time. To show the connections through time of the two. 
Night - GM sits in the mud in front of Edward. The rain has stopped. He reaches for his pen and begins to write. She watches. Hours pass. It becomes morning - He gives her the diary. "Do you now of the... (Use Eddy Merx highlighted quote." He reached for his pistol and shoots himself through the mouth. We do not see it. We see the GM's stricken face and 'hear' the bang. 
PAGE 200 2013
SAUL stumbling through the orchard holding the diary,pursued by Isobel and GM. SAUL running towards the Suicide Tree. Ending with him kneeling with one hand on the tree trunk and the other clutching the diary. Unknowingly he is at his Grandfathers grave.

PANEL 1

INTERIOR. 1767. DAY. DUKES DRAWING ROOM. VALLADOLID. FRANCISCO and GABRIEL stand side by side in the Dukes imposing and ornate room.

PANEL 2

FRANCISCO is nervous. GABRIEL is nervous on his behalf. There is money and reputation riding on the next few minutes.

GABRIEL
I recommended you for this commission. It could be a good move for you if it goes well.

GABRIEL
Wipe your shoe.

PANEL 3

FRANCISCO is kneeling, rubbing his shoe with his hankerchief.

FRANCISCO
Does the Duke know it is my first?

GABRIEL
Of course, but I convinced him you would do a good job.

PANEL 4

GABRIEL looks like he's convincing himself. FRANCISCO is looking at him a little askance.

GABRIEL
You will do a good job, won't you?

PANEL 5

The two men are looking straight ahead, and not at each other.

GABRIEL
By the way, he has a daughter. Pretty, I hear.

PANEL 6

GABRIEL
And, if I hear anything else, I'll have your balls hanging from my mantelpiece in a little bag.

GABRIEL
Stand up straight. He's coming.

PANEL 1

EXTERIOR: 2013. DAY. SUNNY AND WARM. SAULS BACK GARDEN. Saul sits at his patio table drinking red wine rapidly from a large glass. In his left hand is the diary. His drinking hand is shaking a little and he is very hungover.

PANEL 2

OLD FEMALE NEIGHBOUR
Morning Mr Kramer. How are you this fine day?

SAUL
Fine. All fine... (under his breath) ...And if you don't turn that bloody mower off I'm going to give you the sharpest bloody enema you have ever bloody had.

PANEL 3

The neighbour, oblivious, continues to mow her lawn while Saul glowers at her, imagining vengeance.

PANEL 4

Saul settles back into reading. He is fully absorbed. He drinks.

PANEL 5

Saul is suddenly standing bolt upright. The chair has fallen over. His eyes are wide and his mouth is wide open in a ridiculous fashion. His glass has fallen from his hand and spilt red wine onto his crotch and thighs. He still holds the open diary.

SAUL
Oh Francisco... you beautiful beneficent bastard!

PPANEL 1
INTERIOR: DAY. 2013. KATES KITCHEN.
KATE stands at the end of the kitchen worktop. Between her and SAUL is the kitchen table. KATE looks nervous and belligerent at the same time. Her arms are folded and she leans back against the sink. We see her over SAULS shoulder. A dull bruise still shows on her right cheek.
Panel 2
SAUL
Look, Kate-
KATE
Shut up! Just don't say anything! Don't say anything.
Panel 3
KATE is looking at SAUL. SAUL is looking down at the ground. He is ashamed but at the same time knows that she is playing a role - her fear an emotional tool. He cannot fight it.
Panel 4
SAUL
OK. I understand.
KATE
I don't care what you understand, you bastard. I want a divorce.
Panel 5
INTERIOR: DAY. 2013. KATES HALL.
SAUL is opening the front door. KATE is standing at the end of the hall.
KATE (CONT'D)
Do you hear me? Hey!
Panel 6
EXTERIOR: DAY. 2013. KATES FRONT GARDEN.
SAUL is walking along the front garden path. He is facing us. He looks stricken and defeated. We see KATE over his shoulder. Her resentment and simulated fear has bubbled up into her face.
KATE (CONT'D)
Do you hear me? I want that divorce!
